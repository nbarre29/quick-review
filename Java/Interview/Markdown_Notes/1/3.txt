==> I see HashMap is heavily used in our project but Hashtable is not used at all. what is the reason ?

This is a **very common real-world observation** and a **classic interview question**.
Short answer: **`Hashtable` is obsolete for modern Java applications.**

Let’s break it down clearly and practically.

---

## 🔑 One-Line Answer (Interview-Ready)

> **Hashtable is rarely used today because it is legacy, inefficient, and fully synchronized; HashMap (or ConcurrentHashMap) provides better performance and flexibility.**

---

## 1️⃣ `Hashtable` is a legacy class (pre-Java 1.2)

* Introduced in **Java 1.0**
* Designed **before**:

  * Collections Framework
  * Modern concurrency
  * Generics

`HashMap` was introduced later as part of the **Collections Framework**.

---

## 2️⃣ Synchronization model is the BIGGEST problem

### Hashtable (synchronized everywhere ❌)

```java
public synchronized V get(Object key) { ... }
public synchronized V put(K key, V value) { ... }
```

* Every method locks the **entire table**
* Only **one thread** can read/write at a time
* Massive performance bottleneck

---

### HashMap (not synchronized ✅)

```java
Map<K,V> map = new HashMap<>();
```

* No locking
* Very fast
* Perfect for **single-threaded or externally synchronized use**

---

### Modern alternative → `ConcurrentHashMap` ⭐

```java
Map<K,V> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```

* Fine-grained locking
* Lock-striping / CAS
* High concurrency
* Used heavily in real systems

---

## 3️⃣ Null handling (Hashtable is restrictive)

| Feature    | HashMap       | Hashtable     |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Null key   | ✔ allowed (1) | ❌ not allowed |
| Null value | ✔ allowed     | ❌ not allowed |

In modern apps:

* `null` often represents “not present”
* Hashtable forces extra checks

---

## 4️⃣ Poor scalability

### Hashtable

* One global lock
* Threads block each other
* Does not scale on multi-core systems

### ConcurrentHashMap

* Bucket-level locking
* Reads are non-blocking
* Scales very well

---

## 5️⃣ API & design limitations

| Aspect      | Hashtable                       | HashMap                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Generics    | Added later (retrofit)          | Designed with generics |
| Inheritance | Extends `Dictionary` (obsolete) | Implements `Map`       |
| Iteration   | Enumeration (legacy)            | Iterator / Streams     |
| Fail-fast   | ❌ No                            | ✔ Yes                  |

---

## 6️⃣ Why your project uses HashMap but not Hashtable

### Real-world reasons:

* Better performance
* Cleaner API
* Flexible synchronization
* Industry standard
* Works well with Streams, lambdas, frameworks

For concurrency:

```java
HashMap        → single thread
ConcurrentHashMap → multi-thread
```

No need for Hashtable at all.

---

## 7️⃣ Is `Hashtable` ever used today?

### Rare cases:

* Very old legacy systems
* Backward compatibility code
* Never in greenfield projects

Even Oracle docs say:

> **“Hashtable is considered legacy.”**

## 🎯 Interview-Perfect Comparison

| Feature      | HashMap   | Hashtable           |
| ------------ | --------- | ------------------- |
| Thread-safe  | ❌ No      | ✔ Yes (inefficient) |
| Performance  | 🚀 Fast   | 🐢 Slow             |
| Nulls        | ✔ Allowed | ❌ Not allowed       |
| Modern usage | ✔ Yes     | ❌ No                |
| Replacement  | —         | ConcurrentHashMap   |

---

## 🧠 One-Line Memory Trick

> **Hashtable = synchronized dinosaur**
> **HashMap = fast and flexible**
> **ConcurrentHashMap = modern thread-safe choice**

---

## 🏁 Final Verdict

✔ Your project is **doing the right thing**
✔ Avoid `Hashtable` in modern Java
✔ Use `HashMap` or `ConcurrentHashMap`

---

If you want next, I can:

* Compare `HashMap` vs `ConcurrentHashMap` internally
* Explain fail-fast vs fail-safe
* Show migration examples from Hashtable
* Explain why synchronized HashMap is still worse than ConcurrentHashMap
