1) How does `HashMap` work internally? (Java 8+)

2) Swap two strings without temp variable (and why not recommended)

3) I see HashMap is heavily used in our project but Hashtable is not used at all. what is the reason ?

4) Difference between `HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap`

5) Difference between `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`

6) Can we make constructor private? Why?

7) Time complexity notations: O(1)  and O(log n)

8) a) StringBuffer:  multiple threads modify the same instance ( rare today ). Why do you think that it is rare today ?
b) * Explain why `StringBuffer` is still in the JDK
c) StringBuffer vs StringBuilder in tabular form:

9) a) List all the differences between List and Set in tabular form 
b) ArrayList vs LinkedList in tabular form. We didn't use LinkedList in our project. Is LinkedList obsolete ?
c) Our project used HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet a lot. Are these widely used in modern projects ?

d) `ArrayList - for frequent search operations
LinkedList - for frequent insertions and deletions`

I have the above answer to prefer LinkedList for frequent additions. but you say that LinkedList is rarely used nowadays.  I'm confused now .
