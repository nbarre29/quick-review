1) How does `HashMap` work internally? (Java 8+)

2) Swap two strings without temp variable (and why not recommended)

3) I see HashMap is heavily used in our project but Hashtable is not used at all. what is the reason ?

4) Difference between `HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap`

5) Difference between `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, `TreeMap`

6) Can we make constructor private? Why?
