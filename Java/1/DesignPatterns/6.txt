The Adapter pattern in Java is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two interfaces, translating the calls from one interface into a format compatible with the other. This pattern is particularly useful when integrating legacy code, third-party libraries, or components with different interfaces into an existing system without modifying their original source code.
Key Components: 

‚Ä¢ Target Interface: This is the interface that the client expects to work with. 
‚Ä¢ Adaptee: This is the existing class or object with the incompatible interface that needs to be adapted. 
‚Ä¢ Adapter: This is the class that implements the Target Interface and also interacts with the Adaptee. It translates the client's requests (made through the Target Interface) into calls that the Adaptee can understand and execute. 

Types of Adapters: 

‚Ä¢ Class Adapter: Uses inheritance to adapt the Adaptee by extending its class and implementing the Target interface. This approach is limited in Java because it does not support multiple inheritance of classes. 
‚Ä¢ Object Adapter: Uses composition by holding an instance of the Adaptee and implementing the Target interface. This is the more common and flexible approach in Java. 

Example (Object Adapter): 
Suppose you have a legacy OldPlayer class with a playOldFormat() method, and your new system expects an MediaPlayer interface with a play() method. 
// Target Interface
public interface MediaPlayer {
    void play(String fileName);
}

// Adaptee
public class OldPlayer {
    public void playOldFormat(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Playing old format: " + fileName);
    }
}

// Adapter
public class MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer {
    private final OldPlayer oldPlayer;

    public MediaAdapter(OldPlayer oldPlayer) {
        this.oldPlayer = oldPlayer;
    }

    @Override
    public void play(String fileName) {
        oldPlayer.playOldFormat(fileName); // Translate the call
    }
}

// Client
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OldPlayer oldPlayer = new OldPlayer();
        MediaPlayer adapter = new MediaAdapter(oldPlayer);
        adapter.play("legacy_audio.mp3"); // Client uses the adapter with the new interface
    }
}


Output:
Playing old format: legacy_audio.mp3

In this example, MediaAdapter acts as the bridge, allowing the Client to interact with OldPlayer through the MediaPlayer interface, even though their original interfaces are incompatible. 


üîë Key note:

* This is **object adapter** because it uses **composition** (`private OldPlayer oldPlayer`).
* If you had instead done `class MediaAdapter extends OldPlayer implements MediaPlayer`, that would be the **class adapter** (less flexible in Java because of single inheritance).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> convert the above **object adapter** into a **class adapter**.

In Java, a **class adapter** is achieved by using **inheritance**: the adapter `extends` the adaptee (`OldPlayer`) and `implements` the target interface (`MediaPlayer`). That way, no field is needed to hold `OldPlayer`.

Here‚Äôs your rewritten version:


// Target Interface
public interface MediaPlayer {
    void play(String fileName);
}

// Adaptee
public class OldPlayer {
    public void playOldFormat(String fileName) {
        System.out.println("Playing old format: " + fileName);
    }
}

// Adapter (Class Adapter: extends Adaptee + implements Target)
public class MediaAdapter extends OldPlayer implements MediaPlayer {

    @Override
    public void play(String fileName) {
        // Directly call the adaptee‚Äôs method
        playOldFormat(fileName);
    }
}

// Client
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MediaPlayer adapter = new MediaAdapter();
        adapter.play("legacy_audio.mp3"); // Client uses adapter through the new interface
    }
}


Output:
Playing old format: legacy_audio.mp3


### Differences from your object adapter:

* **Object adapter** ‚Üí uses **composition** (`private final OldPlayer oldPlayer`).
* **Class adapter** ‚Üí uses **inheritance** (`extends OldPlayer`).
* In the class adapter, the adapter itself *is* an `OldPlayer`, so it can directly call `playOldFormat()` without holding a separate instance.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation in Java: since Java only allows **single inheritance**, the class adapter approach is less flexible if your adapter already needs to extend another class.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> knowing **when to use object adapter vs. class adapter** is just as important as knowing how to implement them.

## ‚úÖ Object Adapter (composition-based)

**How it works:**
The adapter holds an instance of the adaptee (composition) and delegates calls to it.

```java
class MediaAdapter implements MediaPlayer {
    private final OldPlayer oldPlayer;
    // ...
}
```

**When to prefer:**

1. **Flexibility**

   * You can adapt the adaptee (`OldPlayer`) *and its subclasses* without changing the adapter code.
   * You can even swap the adaptee object at runtime.
   * Example: `MediaAdapter` could wrap `OldPlayer` today and a `SuperOldPlayer` tomorrow.

2. **Loose coupling**

   * Adapter isn‚Äôt tightly bound to the adaptee‚Äôs implementation.
   * Promotes composition-over-inheritance (a good OO principle).

3. **Multiple adaptees**

   * If you need to adapt several unrelated classes into the same target interface, object adapter makes it easier (since you can store different adaptees inside different adapter instances).

---

## ‚úÖ Class Adapter (inheritance-based)

**How it works:**
The adapter extends the adaptee and implements the target interface.

```java
class MediaAdapter extends OldPlayer implements MediaPlayer {
    // ...
}
```

**When to prefer:**

1. **Simplicity**

   * If you only ever need to adapt **one specific class**, inheritance gives a direct, lightweight solution.
   * No extra field (`oldPlayer`) required.

2. **Direct access**

   * Adapter has full access to protected members of the adaptee (since it‚Äôs a subclass).
   * This can make overriding or fine-tuning behavior easier.

3. **No need for switching adaptees**

   * If your system is stable and you won‚Äôt replace `OldPlayer` with another implementation, a class adapter is fine.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Summary (rule of thumb)

* **Use Object Adapter** almost always in **Java**, because:

  * Java has **single inheritance**, so class adapter ties your hands.
  * Composition is more flexible and aligns with the *composition over inheritance* principle.
* **Use Class Adapter** only when:

  * You‚Äôre adapting a **single, final class hierarchy**.
  * You want **direct access** to adaptee internals (protected members).
  * You don‚Äôt need to extend any other class.

---

üëâ So in your **MediaPlayer / OldPlayer** example, the **object adapter** is usually the more practical, real-world choice.
