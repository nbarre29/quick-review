-> The java.util.Arrays was added to the JDK in 2, so it has been a while. It has seen several updates in subsequent releases. The most significant update was in JDK 8; the most recent update was with JDK 9. So if you are still on JDK 8, there might be a few changes youâ€™re unfamiliar with.

-> Copying Arrays

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5};
        int[] copyOfNumbers = Arrays.copyOf(numbers, numbers.length);
        int[] copyOfSomeNumbers  = Arrays.copyOf(numbers, numbers.length - 3);
        int[] copyOfNumbersWithPadding = Arrays.copyOf(numbers, numbers.length + 1);
        System.out.println("Original array: " + Arrays.toString(numbers));
        System.out.println("Copied array: " + Arrays.toString(copyOfNumbers));
        System.out.println("Copied some elements: " + Arrays.toString(copyOfSomeNumbers));
        System.out.println("Copied array with padding: " + Arrays.toString(copyOfNumbersWithPadding));

    }
}

Output:
Original array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Copied array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Copied some elements: [1, 2]
Copied array with padding: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0]

copyOfNumbers - is an example of a simple copy of an array.
copyOfSomeNumbers - is an example of copying only a portion of an array.
copyOfNumbersWithPadding - is an example of copying an array and adding padding. The padded values are the default value for the type; in the case of int, that is 0.

-> Copying Subranges

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5};
        int[] copyOfNumbers = Arrays.copyOfRange(numbers, 0, 3);

        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers)); //[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(copyOfNumbers)); //[1, 2, 3]

    }
}
