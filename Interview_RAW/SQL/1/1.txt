==> claude: ## INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN

### INNER JOIN
Returns only rows where there's a **match in both tables**.

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
```

**Result:** Only employees who belong to a department (and only departments that have employees).

---

### LEFT JOIN
Returns **all rows from the left table**, and matched rows from the right table. If there's no match, right-side columns return `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
```

**Result:** All employees are returned — even those with no department (`department_name` will be `NULL` for them).

### Visual Comparison

| employees | departments | INNER JOIN | LEFT JOIN |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alice (dept 1) | Dept 1: Engineering | ✅ Alice | ✅ Alice |
| Bob (dept 2) | Dept 2: Marketing | ✅ Bob | ✅ Bob |
| Charlie (no dept) | — | ❌ excluded | ✅ Charlie (NULL) |

---

### Key Rule of Thumb

| | INNER JOIN | LEFT JOIN |
|---|---|---|
| Rows returned | Only matches | All left rows + matches |
| Unmatched left rows | Excluded | Included (NULLs on right) |
| Use when... | You need complete data from both sides | You can't afford to lose rows from the left table |

---

### Practical Example — Finding employees WITHOUT a department

```sql
-- LEFT JOIN + NULL check is a common pattern
SELECT employees.name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id
WHERE departments.id IS NULL;
```

This returns only employees who have **no matching department** — something INNER JOIN can't do.

==> share me a downloadable mysql sql script that creates 1) a database,  2)employees and departments table with data and the queries 

Here's your MySQL script! joins_demo.sql,  Here's what's included:

**Setup**
- Creates a fresh `joins_demo` database with `departments` and `employees` tables
- 4 departments, 9 employees (2 intentionally have no department for demo purposes)

**7 Queries**

| # | Query | Concept |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | All employees with their dept | INNER JOIN |
| 2 | All employees including unassigned | LEFT JOIN + COALESCE |
| 3 | Employees with NO department | LEFT JOIN + NULL check |
| 4 | Departments with NO employees | Reverse LEFT JOIN |
| 5 | Dept headcount & salary stats | INNER JOIN + GROUP BY |
| 6 | All depts including empty ones | LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY |
| 7 | Row count comparison (INNER vs LEFT) | UNION ALL |
