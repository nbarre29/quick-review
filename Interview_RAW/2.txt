Congrats on the interview! AI-assisted screening interviews for a Java Developer role typically focus on gauging your fundamentals quickly (since it's only 15–30 mins). Here's what to expect:

**Core Java Fundamentals**
- OOP concepts — inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction
- Difference between abstract class vs interface
- String pool, immutability of String
- `==` vs `.equals()`
- Access modifiers

**Collections & Data Structures**
- HashMap vs HashTable vs ConcurrentHashMap
- ArrayList vs LinkedList
- How HashMap works internally (hashing, collision)
- Comparable vs Comparator

**Java 8+ Features**
- Lambda expressions and Functional interfaces
- Stream API (filter, map, reduce)
- Optional class
- Default methods in interfaces

**Exception Handling**
- Checked vs unchecked exceptions
- try-with-resources
- Custom exceptions

**Multithreading Basics**
- Thread lifecycle
- synchronized keyword
- wait/notify
- volatile keyword

**JVM Internals (basics)**
- Stack vs Heap memory
- Garbage collection basics

**Possible Coding Questions**
Since it's AI-assisted, you may be asked to write or trace simple code like reversing a string, finding duplicates in a list, or a basic Stream API operation.

**Tips for AI-Assisted Interviews:**
- Speak clearly and confidently — AI tools assess your verbal responses
- Don't rush; structure your answers (define → explain → example)
- If asked to code, think out loud
- Avoid very long pauses

Good luck! Would you like me to do a mock Q&A to help you prepare?

==> chatgpt: how **AI-assisted screening rounds** work, especially for large clients like **Bank of America** via vendors like Collabera.

Since it’s:

* ⏱ 15–30 minutes
* 🎥 Video + Audio
* 🤖 AI-assisted
* 📌 Round 1 (Screening)

This is typically a **structured technical + behavioral screening**, not deep architecture yet.

---

# 🔎 What To Expect

AI screening tools usually evaluate:

1. ✅ Core Java fundamentals
2. ✅ Spring / Backend basics
3. ✅ SQL / Database knowledge
4. ✅ REST API understanding
5. ✅ Problem solving approach
6. ✅ Communication clarity
7. ✅ Confidence & structured answers

They are scoring:

* Technical correctness
* Clarity of explanation
* Structure of thinking
* Conciseness

---

# 💻 Technical Questions You Should Expect (Java Developer – Banking Client)

## 1️⃣ Core Java (Very Common)

You WILL likely get 2–4 of these:

* Difference between `HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap`
* Difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`
* What is `volatile`?
* What is the difference between `synchronized` and `ReentrantLock`?
* Explain `equals()` vs `hashCode()`
* What is immutability?
* What is the difference between `Runnable` and `Callable`?
* What is Executor framework?
* What is ForkJoinPool?
* How does garbage collection work?
* What are Java 8 features?
* What is Stream API?
* What is Optional?

👉 Since this is Bank of America, **multithreading questions are VERY common.**

---

## 2️⃣ Spring / Spring Boot

Expect at least 1–2:

* What is dependency injection?
* Constructor vs Setter injection?
* What is @RestController?
* What is @Autowired?
* What is Spring Boot auto-configuration?
* How does Spring Security work?
* What is JWT authentication?
* How does transaction management work?
* What is @Transactional?

---

## 3️⃣ REST & Microservices

* What is REST?
* What is idempotency?
* Difference between PUT and POST?
* How do you handle exceptions globally?
* How do you secure APIs?
* What is stateless architecture?
* How does OAuth2 work?

---

## 4️⃣ Database / SQL

Since it's Bank of America:

* Difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN
* What is indexing?
* What is normalization?
* What is ACID?
* What is isolation level?
* How do you prevent deadlocks?
* What is optimistic vs pessimistic locking?

---

## 5️⃣ Banking Domain Type Questions

Sometimes they test:

* What is transaction consistency?
* How would you design a payment system?
* How do you prevent duplicate transactions?
* How do you ensure idempotency in banking APIs?

---

## 6️⃣ Behavioral / Situational

AI screening almost always includes:

* Tell me about yourself.
* Describe a challenging issue you solved.
* How do you handle production issues?
* Describe a time you handled a conflict.
* Why do you want to work on this project?

They check:

* Structured answer
* Confidence
* Clear storytelling
* No rambling

Use **STAR method** for behavioral.

---

# 🎯 AI-Specific Tips (Very Important)

Since this is AI evaluated:

### ✅ Speak clearly

### ✅ Short structured answers

### ✅ Don’t ramble

### ✅ Avoid fillers (umm, like, basically)

### ✅ Look at camera

### ✅ Use structured answers:

> "There are three main differences..."

AI scoring favors structure.

---

# 📌 They May Also Ask 1 Coding Question

Sometimes:

* Reverse a string
* Find duplicate in array
* Check palindrome
* Print Fibonacci
* Use Java 8 to filter list

Keep solutions clean and explain while coding.

---

# 🔥 Based On YOUR Profile

Since you:

* Work with Spring
* Work with Cassandra
* Work with Redis
* Work with JWT
* Work with Kafka

Be ready for:

* Concurrent processing
* REST security
* Caching
* Microservices communication
* Thread pools

---

# 🚨 What They Usually DON’T Ask In Round 1

* Deep system design
* Very complex DSA
* Architecture patterns in depth
* Distributed system deep dive

That’s Round 2+.

---
