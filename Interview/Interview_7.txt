-> here are the scenario questions listed that someone posted on Linked that he would be asking such interview questions.

1) You inherit a legacy Spring Boot service. It's running fine, but takes 20s to respond under load. How do you approach performance tuning?
looking for Profiling first mindset, understanding of thread pools, database bottlenecks, GC tuning.

2) Users report intermittent 500 errors in production, but logs look clean. How do you debug this?
Looking for understanding of logging levels, tracing ( eg. Zipkin, OpenTelemetry), exception handling, concurrent request handling

3) You're asked to design a backend service for handling 10M+ user requests per day. You have limited infra budget. What's your plan?
Looking for scalability thinking, caching strategies, async processing, build vs buy decisions.

4) Your CI/CD pipeline suddenly slows down from 5 mins to 40 mins. How do you debug?
Looking for ability to identity bottlenecks( dependency downloads , tests, container builds), caching strategies, parallellization and  even use of AI tools like Copilot for YAML / shelll optimization

5) Your microservice consumes messages from Kafka. Suddenly, consumer lag keeps increasing. What steps do you take?
Looking for knowledge of consumer group rebalancing, partition assignment, backpressure handling , monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana scaling strategies

6) A payment API you integrate with has a 2% failure rate under peak traffic. How do you ensure reliable customer experience?
Looking for: Retry with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, idenpotency handling, fallback strategies, SLAs with third parties
