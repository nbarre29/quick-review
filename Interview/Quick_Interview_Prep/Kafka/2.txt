==> If a producer sends 10 messages to topic `orders` (which has 3 partitions), then will each of the 3 partitions get 10 messages each ?

**No.** The total will be **10 messages spread across the 3 partitions**, not 10 messages per partition.

---

### How distribution works

The producer sends 10 messages and Kafka distributes them across the 3 partitions. The total stays at 10. How they're split depends on the **partitioning strategy**:

**If no key is provided (default/round-robin or sticky):**
Kafka spreads messages roughly evenly. With 10 messages and 3 partitions you might get something like:
```
Partition 0 → 4 messages
Partition 1 → 3 messages
Partition 2 → 3 messages
```
The exact split depends on the partitioner and batching behavior (sticky partitioner tends to fill one partition before moving on).

**If a key is provided:**
All messages with the **same key** always go to the **same partition** (via `hash(key) % numPartitions`). So if all 10 messages have the same key, all 10 land on one partition and the other two get nothing.
```
Partition 0 → 10 messages   ← all same key
Partition 1 → 0 messages
Partition 2 → 0 messages
```

**If a partition is specified explicitly:**
The producer can hardcode a target partition, so all 10 go exactly where you point them.

---

### The mental model to remember

Think of it like **dealing 10 cards across 3 piles** — you still only have 10 cards total, just distributed. The partitions are lanes for parallelism, not multipliers of your data.

The only way each partition would get 10 messages is if you sent **30 messages total** with perfectly even distribution — or if you sent to each partition explicitly.

==> A topic is created with `replication-factor=3` and you have 5 brokers. It means that each partition has 3 copies across different brokers right? so two brokers doesn't have any copy right ?

**Yes, exactly right!** 🎯

## Replication Factor = 3 with 5 Brokers

Each partition will have **3 copies** spread across **3 different brokers**, leaving **2 brokers without a copy** of that partition.

**Visual Example** (Topic with 1 partition):

```
Broker 1 ✅ → has a copy (Leader)
Broker 2 ✅ → has a copy (Follower)
Broker 3 ✅ → has a copy (Follower)
Broker 4 ❌ → no copy
Broker 5 ❌ → no copy
```

## Important Details:

**Leader vs Follower:**
- One of the 3 copies is the **Leader** (handles all reads/writes)
- The other 2 are **Followers** (just replicate data from leader)
- If the leader broker dies, one follower is **automatically promoted** to leader

**If you have multiple partitions**, Kafka tries to **spread leaders evenly** across brokers. For example with 3 partitions:
```
Partition 0 → Leader on Broker 1, Followers on Broker 2, 3
Partition 1 → Leader on Broker 2, Followers on Broker 3, 4
Partition 2 → Leader on Broker 3, Followers on Broker 4, 5
```
This way **all 5 brokers** can be utilized!

## Key Rule:
- `replication-factor` **cannot exceed** the number of brokers
- So with 5 brokers, max replication factor = **5**

==> In real world scenario, can we have a Topic with only 1 partition? I know we need multiple partitions in a Topic for Parallelism

**Yes, absolutely!** A topic with only **1 partition** is valid and does happen in real-world scenarios.

## When 1 Partition Makes Sense:

**1. Strict Ordering is Required**
- Kafka only guarantees message order **within a partition**
- If you need **global ordering** of all messages in a topic, you need exactly 1 partition
- Example: **Database change logs** where order of operations matters critically

**2. Low Throughput Topics**
- If the topic doesn't receive much data, 1 partition is perfectly fine
- Example: **Config updates, admin notifications, system alerts**

**3. Small Scale Applications**
- Early stage startups or internal tools where scale isn't a concern yet

---

## The Trade-offs with 1 Partition:

| | 1 Partition | Multiple Partitions |
|---|---|---|
| **Ordering** | ✅ Global order guaranteed | ❌ Only per-partition order |
| **Parallelism** | ❌ Only 1 consumer works | ✅ Multiple consumers work |
| **Throughput** | ❌ Limited | ✅ High |
| **Scalability** | ❌ Cannot scale out | ✅ Easily scalable |

---

## Real World Rule of Thumb:
- **1 partition** → when **ordering matters more than speed**
- **Multiple partitions** → when **throughput matters more than global ordering**

So it's always a **trade-off between ordering and parallelism!**

==> what does throughput and scalability mean in software terms ?

**Throughput** and **scalability** are both about how much work a system can handle, but they’re different.

### Throughput

**Meaning:** *How much work the system completes per unit time.*

Examples:

* Web API: **requests per second (RPS)**
* Kafka: **messages per second** or **MB/sec**
* Database: **transactions per second (TPS)**

High throughput = the system can process a lot of volume per second.

---

### Scalability

**Meaning:** *How well the system can increase capacity when you add resources.*

Two common ways:

* **Vertical scaling (scale up):** bigger machine (more CPU/RAM)
* **Horizontal scaling (scale out):** more machines/instances/partitions/consumers

Good scalability = when you add resources, throughput increases predictably (ideally close to linearly), without the system falling apart.

---

### Quick example (Kafka)

* **Throughput:** “We process **50k orders/sec**.”
* **Scalability:** “If we increase partitions and consumers from 3 to 6, we can process **~100k orders/sec** (close to double).”

---

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

==> what does resilience mean in software terms ?

**Resilience** in software means the system can **keep working (or quickly recover)** when something goes wrong—like failures, spikes, or partial outages—without causing a full breakdown.

What that looks like in practice:

* **Fault tolerance:** one server/consumer/broker dies, the system still runs (maybe slower).
* **Graceful degradation:** it may reduce features or serve cached results instead of crashing.
* **Fast recovery:** it restores service quickly (auto-restart, failover, replay from logs).
* **Data safety:** avoids losing data or keeps it consistent (retries, idempotency, transactions).

Common resilience techniques:

* **Redundancy/replication** (multiple instances, Kafka replicas)
* **Retries with backoff** (don’t hammer a failing dependency)
* **Circuit breakers** (stop calling a broken service temporarily)
* **Time-outs** (don’t hang forever)
* **Load shedding / rate limiting** (protect the system under spikes)
* **Queueing & buffering** (Kafka, SQS to absorb bursts)
* **Idempotency** (safe retries without duplicate side effects)
* **Health checks + autoscaling + failover**

Quick example (Kafka):
If a consumer crashes, the consumer group **rebalances**, another consumer takes over the partitions, and processing continues from the **last committed offset**—that’s resilience.

==> can a single machine have multple kafka brokers. what is actually a broker ?

Yes, technically a single machine can run multiple Kafka brokers (each with a different `broker.id` and port), but this is only done in development/testing. In production, you'd want one broker per machine to actually get the fault tolerance and performance benefits.

**What is a broker?**

A broker is simply a Kafka server process. It's a JVM process running on a machine that is responsible for storing messages on disk, serving reads and writes from producers/consumers, and participating in the cluster. When you start Kafka, you're starting a broker.

The cluster is just a group of these broker processes working together. Topics are divided into partitions, and those partitions are spread across brokers — so each broker "owns" some partitions and acts as the leader for them.

Think of it like this: It's just a server doing the actual work.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

==> I have only 1 windows machine and I want multiple brokers on this machine.  How do you setup kafka to have multiple brokers ?

Yes! On a single Windows machine you can run multiple brokers by running multiple Kafka server processes, each with its own config file.

**What you change per broker:**

You essentially copy `server.properties` for each broker and change 3 things:

- `broker.id` — must be unique (0, 1, 2...)
- `port` (or `listeners`) — each broker needs a different port (9092, 9093, 9094...)
- `log.dirs` — different directory to store data (kafka-logs-1, kafka-logs-2...)

All brokers point to the **same Zookeeper** (or KRaft cluster), which is how they discover each other and form a cluster.

**Then you start each broker separately:**

```bash
kafka-server-start.bat config/server1.properties
kafka-server-start.bat config/server2.properties
kafka-server-start.bat config/server3.properties
```

Each runs as a separate process on your machine, on different ports, but they all register with the same Zookeeper and form a single Kafka cluster.

So from Kafka's perspective it looks like a 3-broker cluster — it just happens that all 3 are on the same physical machine. That's why it's fine for learning but bad for production (if the machine dies, all brokers die).

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

==> modern kafka doesn't have zookeeper right ?

Yes, correct! Since **Kafka 2.8** (and made the default/stable in **Kafka 3.3+**), Kafka introduced **KRaft mode** (Kafka Raft) which removes the Zookeeper dependency entirely.

**In KRaft mode**, Kafka manages its own metadata internally using the Raft consensus protocol — so one or more brokers act as "controllers" that handle what Zookeeper used to handle (leader election, cluster metadata, etc.).

So the updated setup for multiple brokers on one machine would have all brokers pointing to the same **KRaft controller** instead of Zookeeper. The controller itself can be a separate process or one of the brokers can play both roles (broker + controller), which is common in local/dev setups.

Zookeeper is still mentioned a lot in tutorials and interview material simply because most learning resources haven't fully caught up yet, but for any fresh Kafka installation today you'd use KRaft.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

==> but why do i still here zookeeper like in this sentence you said earlier "Each runs as a separate process on your machine, on different ports, but they all register with the same Zookeeper and form a single Kafka cluster."

Fair point — I should have said KRaft there instead of Zookeeper. That was my mistake, I defaulted to the older explanation without updating it.

To correct that sentence: *"All brokers point to the same KRaft controller and form a single Kafka cluster."*

The reason you still hear Zookeeper mentioned so much is:

- **Legacy** — Kafka used Zookeeper for ~10 years, so a huge amount of documentation, tutorials, books, and courses were written with it
- **Many production systems still run it** — companies haven't all migrated yet
- **Interview content is slow to update** — a lot of interview prep material still teaches the Zookeeper model

But if you're learning Kafka fresh today, just know that **KRaft is the current standard** and Zookeeper is the old way. The core concepts (brokers, partitions, topics, replication) are the same regardless.
