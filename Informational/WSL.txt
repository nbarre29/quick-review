-> What is containerd.io?

The containerd.io package installs containerd, which is a core container runtime. It's not a full-featured container engine like Docker, but rather a lower-level component that manages the container lifecycle.

Think of it this way:

1. Docker Engine is the complete platform. It provides a user-friendly API, the Docker CLI, image management, networking, and a lot more. It's what you interact with daily to build and run containers.
2. containerd is the "engine under the hood." It's responsible for the nitty-gritty details of running a container, such as starting, stopping, and managing the container's filesystem.

When you install Docker, you're actually installing a suite of tools, and containerd is a critical part of that suite. The Docker Engine uses containerd to handle the actual creation and execution of the containers you manage with the docker command.


# Download containerd.io package
curl -fsSL -o containerd.io_1.7.25-1_amd64.deb \
https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/dists/noble/pool/stable/amd64/containerd.io_1.7.25-1_amd64.deb


# Install it
sudo dpkg -i containerd.io_1.7.25-1_amd64.deb



// if there are dependency issues we can simply install Docker and its dependencies correctly as below:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

nbarre@nbarre:~$ sudo apt-get update
nbarre@nbarre:~$ sudo apt-get install containerd.io

# Add user group
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

Command 1: sudo groupadd docker
groupadd: This is a command-line utility used to create a new user group.
sudo: This is the "superuser do" command, which temporarily elevates your privileges to that of the root user. You need this because creating a new user group is a system-level action that requires administrative rights.
docker: This is the name of the new group you are creating.

Command 2:  sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

usermod: This is the command used to modify a user's account.
-a: This flag stands for "append." It tells usermod to add the user to a new group without removing them from any other groups they are already a part of. This is a very important flag—if you forget it, you'll be removed from all your other groups (like sudo), which could cause issues.
-G docker: This flag specifies the group (docker) that you want to add the user to.
${USER}: This is an environment variable that automatically expands to your current username. For example, if your username is nbarre, this command will become sudo usermod -aG docker nbarre. Using this variable makes the command portable and ensures it works for any user.


groupadd docker → creates a group to control Docker access.
usermod -aG docker ${USER} → puts your account into that group.
After re-login, you can run Docker commands without sudo.
