==> Opus 4.6: Auth0 vs Okta ?

## Auth0 vs Okta

**Okta acquired Auth0 in May 2021** for $6.5 billion — they are now under the **same parent company** but remain **separate products** targeting different audiences.

### Key Difference

| | **Auth0** | **Okta** |
|---|---|---|
| **Target** | **Developers** (Customer Identity) | **IT Admins** (Workforce Identity) |
| **Primary use** | B2C / B2B — external user login | B2E — employee SSO & access management |
| **Persona** | Engineering teams | IT / security teams |

### Detailed Comparison

| Aspect | **Auth0** | **Okta** |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Code-first, SDK-driven | Admin console / UI-driven |
| **Integration** | Drop-in SDKs (Spring Boot, React, etc.) | 7,000+ pre-built enterprise app connectors |
| **Social login** | First-class (Google, GitHub, etc.) | Supported but not primary focus |
| **Customization** | Highly flexible (Actions, custom DB) | More opinionated, enterprise policies |
| **Directory** | Lightweight user store | Full directory + AD/LDAP sync |
| **MFA** | ✅ | ✅ (more enterprise MFA options) |
| **Protocols** | OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML | OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML, SCIM |
| **Pricing model** | Per external user | Per employee/seat |
| **Free tier** | 7,500 users | Limited trial |

### Spring Boot Integration — Both identical

Both issue JWTs and expose JWKS endpoints, so your `StockController` security config is the same:

```yaml
# Auth0
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: https://your-tenant.auth0.com/
```

```yaml
# Okta
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: https://your-org.okta.com/oauth2/default
```

### When to use which

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Customer/consumer-facing login | **Auth0** |
| Developer building a SaaS product | **Auth0** |
| Employee SSO to Salesforce, Slack, Jira | **Okta** |
| Enterprise IT managing 10,000\+ employees | **Okta** |
| Need social logins + quick dev setup | **Auth0** |
| Need SCIM provisioning + HR system sync | **Okta** |

### Post-Acquisition Reality

Okta now brands them as:
- **Okta Customer Identity Cloud** → Auth0
- **Okta Workforce Identity Cloud** → Original Okta

They share some backend infrastructure but remain **separate platforms** with separate dashboards, APIs, and SDKs.

### Quick Summary

| | Auth0 | Okta |
|---|---|---|
| **Analogy** | Lock on your **front door** (customers come in) | Badge system for your **office building** (employees get access) |
| **Built for** | Your app's users | Your company's employees |

**In short:** Auth0 secures **your customers** logging into apps like the one serving `/stocks`. Okta secures **your employees** accessing internal corporate tools. Same company now, different products for different problems.

==> What does Persona mean below:
 | | **Auth0** | **Okta** |
|---|---|---|
| **Target** | **Developers** (Customer Identity) | **IT Admins** (Workforce Identity) |
| **Primary use** | B2C / B2B — external user login | B2E — employee SSO & access management |
| **Persona** | Engineering teams | IT / security teams |


In this context, **Persona** refers to the **type of user/team** the product is primarily designed for and marketed to — essentially, *who is the intended audience* using the product day-to-day.

So in this table:

- **Auth0 → Engineering teams**: Auth0 is built with developers in mind. It has developer-friendly SDKs, docs, and APIs. The people integrating and managing it are typically software engineers.

- **Okta → IT / security teams**: Okta is designed to be managed by IT admins and security professionals, not necessarily developers. Think configuring SSO policies, managing employee access, compliance — tasks that IT departments handle.

It's basically answering the question: **"Who sits down and actually uses/manages this product?"**

This is a common concept in product design — companies define personas (fictional or categorical representations of their ideal users) to shape how they build and position their product.
