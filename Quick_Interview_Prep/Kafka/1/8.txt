==> What is an offset ?
https://docs.confluent.io/  Confluent AI Assistant

RESPONSE:
An offset is an integer value that uniquely represents the position of a message within a data stream in Kafka. Offsets guarantee the ordering of records and enable consumers to replay messages from any point in time within a partition.

- Each message in a Kafka partition is assigned an offset as it is produced.
- Offsets are unique within a partition, ensuring that each record can be individually identified.
- Consumers use offsets to keep track of which messages they have read. This allows them to resume consuming from a specific position in the stream if needed.
- By managing offsets, it’s possible to process messages again (replay) or skip over messages as required.

This mechanism is fundamental for reliable stream processing and message delivery semantics in Kafka environments.

==> what is a consumer group ?
https://docs.confluent.io/  Confluent AI Assistant

A consumer group in Kafka is a set of consumers that collaboratively read data from one or more topics, allowing for horizontal scalability and fault tolerance. The group works together to process messages in parallel, with each consumer assigned a subset of topic partitions.

Here’s how consumer groups function:

- Each consumer group is identified by a unique group ID.
- Kafka automatically divides and assigns partitions from subscribed topics among consumers in the group so that each partition is consumed by only one member at any time.
- As you add more consumers to the group, Kafka redistributes partitions to maintain balance—this process is called rebalancing.
- If there are more partitions than consumers, some consumers will be assigned multiple partitions. If there are more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be idle.
- Consumer groups provide scalability: more consumers let you process more messages simultaneously.
- They also provide resilience: if a consumer fails, other group members take over its partitions and continue processing, reducing downtime.
- Typically, consumer groups are used for shared workload scenarios, such as processing, analytics, or notification systems.

For example, in an e-commerce platform, you might have a group called "email" with several consumers to send order confirmation emails, and another group called "sales" with one consumer to aggregate sales metrics.

If you want to use consumer groups, simply assign the same group ID (`group.id`) to all participating consumers when configuring them.

You can manage consumer groups using the Confluent Cloud Console or the Control Center (on Confluent Platform). If you’re interested in CLI, API, or other methods for managing consumer groups, let me know and I can provide details.
