-> 1)  Rate Sheet Adjuster (a.k.a. LLPA, price hit, price incentive)
A Rate Sheet Adjuster is a pricing modifier applied to a loan's base price or rate, based on certain loan attributes.

✅ Purpose:
To adjust the loan pricing (either positively or negatively) based on risk factors or business strategies.

📌 Examples of Adjusters:
Loan-to-Value (LTV) adjuster: +0.250%

Credit Score adjuster: -0.125%

Occupancy Type (investment property): +0.500%

Loan Purpose (cash-out refinance): +0.375%

🧠 Think of it like:
“Your base rate is 6.500%, but because the borrower has a low credit score and high LTV, we’ll add +0.625% in pricing hits.”

The pricing engine calculates: Final Price = Base Price + Sum of All Adjusters


-> 2)  Eligibility (Loan Eligibility)
Eligibility refers to whether a given loan meets the rules or requirements of a loan program or investor.

📌 Common Eligibility Criteria:
Max LTV: ≤ 80%
Min credit score: ≥ 620
Property type allowed: single-family only
DTI ratio: ≤ 43%

🟩 Outcomes:
Eligible – The loan can be delivered/sold to the investor.

Ineligible – The loan does not meet investor guidelines.

ExceptionPass – The loan violates a rule but is allowed under a documented exception.

Refer/Manual Review – Needs human override or decision.

Conventional loan is nor insured by any government agency. 
There are two types of coventional mortgages 1) conforming 2) non-conforming


Conventional mortgages are not government-backed, and they fall into two main categories:

🏠 1. Conforming Loans
These meet the guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including:

✅ Loan limits (e.g., $766,550 in most U.S. counties for 2024)
✅ Credit score requirements
✅ Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio
✅ Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio

Why it matters:

Easier to sell on the secondary market
Often come with lower interest rates


🚫 2. Non-Conforming Loans
These do NOT meet Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac criteria. Types include:

Jumbo Loans: Loan amount exceeds conforming limit
Alt-A Loans: Not quite subprime, but riskier than conforming
Subprime Loans: For borrowers with poor credit
Portfolio Loans: Held by the lender instead of being sold

Why it matters:

Higher risk for lenders → often higher rates or stricter terms
May offer more flexibility in documentation or credit requirements


| Type            | Meets GSE Guidelines? | Typical Use Case                  |
| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Conforming Loan | ✅ Yes                 | Most standard home loans          |
| Non-Conforming  | ❌ No                  | Jumbo, subprime, or special cases |


What does GSE mean?
GSE stands for Government-Sponsored Enterprise.

In mortgage terms, the two key GSEs are:
Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association)
Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation)

✅ What GSEs do:
1) They buy mortgages from lenders (banks, credit unions, etc.)
2) Package them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
3) Sell them to investors on the secondary market

This process:

Provides liquidity to the housing market
Encourages lenders to offer more loans with consistent guidelines

->  What Is Equity on a Home?
Home equity is the portion of your home that you truly own — it's the difference between your home’s market value and the balance you still owe on your mortgage.

Home Equity = Current Market Value of Home - Outstanding Mortgage Balance


Example:
| Detail                     | Value         |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| Home’s market value        | \$400,000     |
| Remaining mortgage balance | \$250,000     |
| 👉 Your equity             | **\$150,000** |


Why Home Equity Matters:
You can borrow against it (via a HELOC or cash-out refinance)

It grows over time as:
You pay down your mortgage
Your home value increases

🔄 Types of Home Equity Usage:
Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)
Cash-out refinance
Selling your home (you receive the equity as cash)

__________________________________________________________________________________________

-> DTI ratio stands for Debt-to-Income ratio. It's a key metric lenders use to evaluate a borrower's ability to manage monthly payments and repay debts.

As I explained in the previous response, DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratio is calculated using two main formulas:

1. Front-End DTI (Housing DTI):

(Total Monthly Housing Costs / Gross Monthly Income) x 100%

Total Monthly Housing Costs typically include:

Principal and Interest (P&I) on the mortgage
Property Taxes (T)
Homeowners Insurance (I)
Mortgage Insurance (MI) (if applicable)
Homeowners Association (HOA) fees (if applicable)
Gross Monthly Income is your total income before taxes and other deductions, on a monthly basis. This includes salary, wages, bonuses, commissions, self-employment income, and other regular income sources.


2. Back-End DTI (Total DTI):

(Total Monthly Debt Payments / Gross Monthly Income) x 100%

Total Monthly Debt Payments includes all recurring monthly debt obligations, such as:

All items included in "Total Monthly Housing Costs" (from the front-end DTI)
Minimum payments on credit cards
Auto loan payments
Student loan payments
Personal loan payments
Child support or alimony payments
Any other regular debt obligations
Gross Monthly Income is the same as used in the front-end DTI calculation (your total income before taxes and deductions, on a monthly basis).

Example:
Total monthly debts (car loan, credit cards, mortgage): $2,000
Gross monthly income (before taxes): $5,000

DTI = ( 2000 / 5000 ) x 100 = 40%


Why it matters:
Lower DTI (below 36%) is considered ideal by most lenders.
Higher DTI may indicate risk, making it harder to qualify for loans or better rates.

Summary:
Two types often used:
Front-End DTI: Housing-related payments only (e.g., mortgage, taxes, insurance).
Back-End DTI: Includes all monthly debt obligations.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

-> 1) Loan Amount
Definition: The loan amount is the total amount of money a borrower is borrowing from a lender to purchase a home.

Example: If you're buying a house worth $400,000 and making a $100,000 down payment, your loan amount would be $300,000.

2) Appraised Value
Definition: The appraised value is the estimated market value of the home as determined by a professional appraiser. Lenders use this to ensure the property is worth the amount being financed.

Note: The loan is usually based on the lower of the appraised value or purchase price.

3) Purchase Price
Definition: The purchase price is the price you agree to pay the seller to buy the property. It may or may not match the appraised value.

Example: You might agree to buy a home for $350,000, even if the appraised value is $360,000 or $340,000.

How They Work Together
If a home’s appraised value is less than the purchase price, the lender will base the loan on the appraised value — and you may have to make up the difference with a larger down payment.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

-> LTV stands for Loan-to-Value ratio. It is a financial term used by lenders to assess the risk of a mortgage loan by comparing the loan amount to the appraised value (or purchase price) of the property.

Formula: LTV = ( Loan Amount / Appraised Property Value ) x 100

Example: 
Home Value: $400,000
Loan Amount: $320,000

LTV= (320,000 / 400,000) x 100 = 80%


Why LTV matters:
Lower LTV (≤80%) → Less risk for the lender; better loan terms and no mortgage insurance required in many cases.

Higher LTV (>80%) → More risk; may require private mortgage insurance (PMI) or higher interest rates.


Lenders use LTV to:
Approve or deny a loan.
Set the interest rate.
Determine if PMI is needed.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

-> cash-out refinance:

A cash-out refinance is a type of mortgage refinancing where you replace your existing home loan with a new, larger loan—and take the difference in cash.

How It Works
Suppose your home is worth $400,000, and you owe $250,000 on your current mortgage.

You refinance for $300,000
Pay off the existing $250,000 loan
You receive $50,000 in cash (minus fees)

🔹 Why People Use It
Borrowers use a cash-out refinance to:
Consolidate high-interest debt
Pay for home improvements
Cover large expenses (tuition, medical bills, etc.)
Invest in other property or business

| Home Value | Current Mortgage | New Loan  | Cash Out |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------- | -------- |
| \$400,000  | \$250,000        | \$300,000 | \$50,000 |

-> "Occupancy Type: Investment Property" refers to a classification indicating that the borrower does not intend to live in the property as their primary residence. Instead, the property is purchased primarily to generate income, typically by renting it out or holding it for appreciation.

Key Characteristics and Implications:

Borrower's Intent: The crucial factor is the borrower's stated intention. They are buying the property to lease it to tenants and earn rental income.

Higher Risk for Lenders: Lenders generally view investment properties as riskier than primary residences. Borrowers might be more likely to prioritize payments on their own home if facing financial difficulties. Vacancy periods and property management responsibilities can also impact the borrower's ability to make mortgage payments.

Stricter Underwriting Requirements: Due to the higher perceived risk, lenders typically have stricter underwriting requirements for investment property mortgages compared to primary residences. This often includes:
a) Higher Credit Scores: Borrowers usually need a stronger credit history to qualify.
b) Larger Down Payments: Lenders often require a larger down payment (e.g., 15-25% or more) for investment properties.
Lower Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratios: Lenders want to see a comfortable margin between the borrower's income and all debt obligations, considering the potential for vacancy or management costs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> Other Common Occupancy Types:

1) Primary Residence

The property is the borrower’s main home.
Must be occupied within 60 days of closing (typically).
Offers the lowest mortgage rates and best terms.

2) Second Home / Vacation Home

Property is not a primary residence, but the borrower intends to live in it part-time.
Must be available for personal use, not rented out full-time.
Interest rates slightly higher than for primary residence.

3) Investment Property

Borrower does not live in the property.
Intended for rental income, short-term rentals (Airbnb), or capital gains.
Typically has higher interest rates, stricter requirements, and lower LTV limits.


Summary Table:

| Occupancy Type    | Owner Lives There? | Rental Use Allowed?   | Interest Rate Impact |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Primary Residence | Yes (full-time)    | Occasionally          | Lowest               |
| Second Home       | Yes (part-time)    | Limited (seasonal)    | Slightly higher      |
| Investment        | No                 | Yes (primary purpose) | Highest              |
