-> 1)  Rate Sheet Adjuster (a.k.a. LLPA, price hit, price incentive)
A Rate Sheet Adjuster is a pricing modifier applied to a loan's base price or rate, based on certain loan attributes.

✅ Purpose:
To adjust the loan pricing (either positively or negatively) based on risk factors or business strategies.

📌 Examples of Adjusters:
Loan-to-Value (LTV) adjuster: +0.250%

Credit Score adjuster: -0.125%

Occupancy Type (investment property): +0.500%

Loan Purpose (cash-out refinance): +0.375%

🧠 Think of it like:
“Your base rate is 6.500%, but because the borrower has a low credit score and high LTV, we’ll add +0.625% in pricing hits.”

The pricing engine calculates: Final Price = Base Price + Sum of All Adjusters


-> 2)  Eligibility (Loan Eligibility)
Eligibility refers to whether a given loan meets the rules or requirements of a loan program or investor.

📌 Common Eligibility Criteria:
Max LTV: ≤ 80%

Min credit score: ≥ 620

Property type allowed: single-family only

DTI ratio: ≤ 43%

🟩 Outcomes:
Eligible – The loan can be delivered/sold to the investor.

Ineligible – The loan does not meet investor guidelines.

ExceptionPass – The loan violates a rule but is allowed under a documented exception.

Refer/Manual Review – Needs human override or decision.

Conventional loan is nor insured by any government agency. 
There are two types of coventional mortgages 1) conforming 2) non-conforming


Conventional mortgages are not government-backed, and they fall into two main categories:

🏠 1. Conforming Loans
These meet the guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including:

✅ Loan limits (e.g., $766,550 in most U.S. counties for 2024)
✅ Credit score requirements
✅ Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio
✅ Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio

Why it matters:

Easier to sell on the secondary market
Often come with lower interest rates


🚫 2. Non-Conforming Loans
These do NOT meet Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac criteria. Types include:

Jumbo Loans: Loan amount exceeds conforming limit
Alt-A Loans: Not quite subprime, but riskier than conforming
Subprime Loans: For borrowers with poor credit
Portfolio Loans: Held by the lender instead of being sold

Why it matters:

Higher risk for lenders → often higher rates or stricter terms
May offer more flexibility in documentation or credit requirements


| Type            | Meets GSE Guidelines? | Typical Use Case                  |
| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Conforming Loan | ✅ Yes                 | Most standard home loans          |
| Non-Conforming  | ❌ No                  | Jumbo, subprime, or special cases |


What does GSE mean?
GSE stands for Government-Sponsored Enterprise.

In mortgage terms, the two key GSEs are:
Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association)
Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation)

✅ What GSEs do:
1) They buy mortgages from lenders (banks, credit unions, etc.)
2) Package them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS)
3) Sell them to investors on the secondary market

This process:

Provides liquidity to the housing market
Encourages lenders to offer more loans with consistent guidelines

->  What Is Equity on a Home?
Home equity is the portion of your home that you truly own — it's the difference between your home’s market value and the balance you still owe on your mortgage.

Home Equity = Current Market Value of Home - Outstanding Mortgage Balance


Example:
| Detail                     | Value         |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| Home’s market value        | \$400,000     |
| Remaining mortgage balance | \$250,000     |
| 👉 Your equity             | **\$150,000** |


Why Home Equity Matters:
You can borrow against it (via a HELOC or cash-out refinance)

It grows over time as:
You pay down your mortgage
Your home value increases

🔄 Types of Home Equity Usage:
Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)
Cash-out refinance
Selling your home (you receive the equity as cash)
