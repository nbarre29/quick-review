-> Loan Programs

In mortgage terminology, names like:

* **Jumbo**
* **Jumbo Manual**
* **Jumbo AUS**
* **Agency Enhanced**

are indeed examples of **loan programs** (sometimes also called **loan products** depending on your company’s internal naming convention).

---

### 🔹 Here’s what that means in context

Each of those terms represents a **distinct set of lending rules and eligibility criteria** that define *how* the loan is processed, priced, and underwritten.

| Loan Program        | Meaning / Key Features                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jumbo**           | A loan amount that exceeds conforming loan limits set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These are funded and held by private investors.                                                  |
| **Jumbo Manual**    | A **Jumbo loan** that is **manually underwritten** — i.e., an underwriter reviews credit, income, and assets instead of relying on an automated system.                               |
| **Jumbo AUS**       | A **Jumbo loan** that uses an **Automated Underwriting System (AUS)** for eligibility (like DU or LP). Some investors allow this for streamlined processing.                          |
| **Agency Enhanced** | A **conforming loan** that follows **Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac (“agency”)** guidelines but with **enhanced features** — e.g., higher LTVs, expanded DTI, or special pricing adjustments. |

---

### 🔹 Why they are considered Loan Programs

Each of these:

* Defines **loan limits**, **credit score cutoffs**, **LTV/DTI caps**, and **rate sheets**
* Is selectable in pricing or underwriting systems (like Optimal Blue, Encompass, or your internal pricing engine)
* Drives logic for eligibility, pricing, and documentation requirements

-> Non-QM and DSCR are also Loan Programs

| Category            | Is it a Loan Program? | Description                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Jumbo**           | ✅ Yes                 | Above conforming limit loans            |
| **Agency Enhanced** | ✅ Yes                 | Conforming with expanded guidelines     |
| **Non-QM**          | ✅ Yes                 | Non-qualified loans (flexible rules)    |
| **DSCR**            | ✅ Yes                 | Investment property loans based on rent |

-> JPQM30 and JPQM15 

Excellent question — and you’re clearly thinking like someone building or interpreting a **mortgage pricing or eligibility engine** 👏

Let’s decode those two terms:

---

### 🔹 **JPQM30** and **JPQM15**

These are **specific loan program codes** (or product codes) used *within the Jumbo Manual loan family*.

They typically stand for:

| Code       | Expanded Name                                        | Typical Meaning                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JPQM30** | **Jumbo Program Qualified Mortgage – 30 Year Fixed** | A **Jumbo Manual** loan that meets **Qualified Mortgage (QM)** rules, with a **30-year fixed rate term** |
| **JPQM15** | **Jumbo Program Qualified Mortgage – 15 Year Fixed** | A **Jumbo Manual** loan that meets **QM** rules, with a **15-year fixed rate term**                      |

---

### 🔹 Breaking It Down

Let’s unpack the naming convention piece by piece:

| Part        | Meaning                                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **J**       | Jumbo (the overall loan category)                                                                 |
| **P**       | Program (sometimes stands for “Product” or “Program Type”)                                        |
| **QM**      | Qualified Mortgage — meaning it meets the CFPB’s *Ability-to-Repay* and *QM* safe harbor criteria |
| **30 / 15** | Loan term in years (30-year or 15-year fixed)                                                     |

So:
**JPQM30 = Jumbo Program (Manual) Qualified Mortgage, 30-year fixed**
**JPQM15 = Jumbo Program (Manual) Qualified Mortgage, 15-year fixed**

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

-> JPQM30, JPQM15, JPQM56, JPQM76, JPQM106

Those codes — **JPQM30, JPQM15, JPQM56, JPQM76, JPQM106** — are **loan program codes** (or **product codes**) used internally by lenders or pricing engines, especially for **Jumbo Non-QM loan programs**. Let’s break them down:

---

### 🔹 General Pattern:

**JPQMxx**

* **J** → Jumbo
* **PQM** → likely stands for *Prime / Private / Portfolio Qualified Mortgage* (or *Jumbo Prime Qualified Mortgage*) — it refers to **Non-QM or near-prime Jumbo loans**.
* **xx** → the **number** usually represents the **loan term or program type**.

---

### 🔍 Likely Meaning of Each Code:

| Code        | Likely Meaning                     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JPQM30**  | Jumbo Prime / Non-QM 30-Year Fixed | A **30-year fixed-rate Jumbo Non-QM** loan program. Typically for borrowers who don’t meet standard agency (Fannie/Freddie) criteria but qualify under lender-specific guidelines. |
| **JPQM15**  | Jumbo Prime / Non-QM 15-Year Fixed | A **15-year fixed-rate Jumbo Non-QM** loan program. Shorter term, lower rate, higher monthly payment.                                                                              |
| **JPQM56**  | Jumbo Prime / Non-QM 5/6 ARM       | A **5-year adjustable-rate mortgage** where rate adjusts every 6 months after initial 5 years. (“5/6” = 5 years fixed, adjusts every 6 months.)                                    |
| **JPQM76**  | Jumbo Prime / Non-QM 7/6 ARM       | A **7-year ARM**, fixed for 7 years, adjusts every 6 months afterward.                                                                                                             |
| **JPQM106** | Jumbo Prime / Non-QM 10/6 ARM      | A **10-year ARM**, fixed for 10 years, adjusts every 6 months thereafter. Most stable ARM option among the three.                                                                  |

---

### 💡 Context:

These codes typically appear in:

* **Rate sheets / Pricing Engines** (e.g., Optimal Blue, EPPS, Polly)
* **Lock Desk systems**
* **Loan origination systems (LOS)** under the “Loan Program” dropdown

They define what type of **product** the borrower is locking — in this case, a **Jumbo Non-QM loan**, either **fixed** or **ARM** (adjustable).

---

### 🏠 Summary:

All of these are **Jumbo Non-QM loan programs**, where:

* “JPQM” = Jumbo Prime/Non-QM
* The number indicates the **term and ARM structure**:

  * `30` → 30-year fixed
  * `15` → 15-year fixed
  * `56` → 5/6 ARM
  * `76` → 7/6 ARM
  * `106` → 10/6 ARM

-> What Is a Conforming Loan Limit?

This is a core concept in the U.S. mortgage industry.

A **Conforming Loan Limit** is the maximum dollar amount set by the **Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)** that a single mortgage loan can have while still being eligible for purchase by **Fannie Mae** and **Freddie Mac**.

In simple terms, it is the threshold that determines if your loan is a **Conventional Loan** (conforming) or a **Jumbo Loan** (non-conforming). 

---

## Why Conforming Limits Matter
The conforming loan limit is crucial because it dictates who can buy the loan and, consequently, how the loan is priced.

### 1. The Role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). They do not lend money directly to borrowers; instead, they buy mortgages from primary lenders (banks, credit unions) and package them into securities to sell to investors. This process provides liquidity to the entire housing market.


When a loan **conforms** to their size limit and underwriting standards, it means:

* **Standardization:** The loan meets the strict, standardized criteria (credit score, debt ratio, documentation) required by the GSEs.
* **Liquidity:** The lender knows they can easily sell the loan to Fannie or Freddie. This transfer of risk and immediate cash flow allows the lender to make more loans.


### 2. Impact on Interest Rates

Loans that conform to the limit are viewed as lower risk because they are backed by the GSEs. This makes them highly desirable to investors, which results in:

* **Lower Interest Rates:** Conforming loans almost always have **lower interest rates** than non-conforming (Jumbo) loans.
* **Easier Qualifications:** The qualification process is generally more straightforward and automated through the GSEs' systems (like DU or LPA).

---


## How the Limit is Calculated

The FHFA sets the baseline conforming loan limit annually based on a federal housing price index.

1.  **Baseline Limit (General):** This is the standard limit that applies to most counties in the United States.
2.  **High-Cost Areas:** In areas where the median home value significantly exceeds the baseline, the FHFA adjusts the limit higher, up to **150%** of the baseline. These are called **high-balance conforming loans** or **high-cost area loans**, and they still qualify for purchase by the GSEs.

### Example

If the standard conforming limit for a single-family home is set at, say, **$766,550**:

* **Loan of $700,000:** This is a **Conforming Loan**.
* **Loan of $800,000:** This is a **Non-Conforming (Jumbo) Loan** in a standard county, and it must be held on the lender's books or sold to a private investor.
* **Loan of $800,000 in a High-Cost Area:** If the local high-cost limit is $1,149,825, this is still a **Conforming High-Balance Loan**.

The limit provides the critical dividing line in mortgage financing between the widely traded, low-risk loans and the more specialized, higher-rate Jumbo loans.
