-> **PITI** is an acronym lenders use in mortgages to describe the **total monthly housing payment** a borrower will owe.

It stands for:

1. **P â€“ Principal**

   * The portion of your mortgage payment that reduces the loan balance.
   * Example: If you borrowed $200,000, each month part of your payment goes toward lowering that balance.

2. **I â€“ Interest**

   * The lenderâ€™s charge for letting you borrow money.
   * Based on your loan balance and interest rate.

3. **T â€“ Taxes**

   * Property taxes owed to the local government.
   * Usually collected monthly and put into an **escrow account** so the lender can pay them on your behalf.

4. **I â€“ Insurance**

   * Homeownerâ€™s insurance premium, and sometimes **private mortgage insurance (PMI)** if you put less than 20% down.
   * Like taxes, itâ€™s often escrowed.

### ðŸ”¹ Why PITI Matters

* Lenders use **PITI** (not just principal & interest) when calculating **DTI (Debt-to-Income ratio)** for mortgage qualification.
* Ensures you can afford the *full cost* of homeownership, not just the loan itself.

âœ… **Example**:

* Principal & Interest: **$1,200**
* Taxes: **$300**
* Insurance: **$100**
* **Total PITI = $1,600/month**
