-> DSCR loans are specifically and exclusively for investment properties. They are not for a primary residence or a vacation home.

DSCR, or Debt Service Coverage Ratio, is a financial metric used to measure an entity's ability to pay its debt obligations with its available cash flow.

The key difference between a DSCR loan and a traditional mortgage is the focus of the underwriting process. With a traditional mortgage for a primary residence, lenders look at your personal finances‚Äîyour income, your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, your tax returns, and your W-2s.

With a DSCR loan, the lender primarily evaluates the property's ability to generate income to cover its own debt. The calculation is straightforward:
DSCR = Net Operating Income (NOI) / Total Debt Service

	Net Operating Income (NOI) is the income the property generates from rent, minus its operating expenses (like property taxes and insurance).

	Total Debt Service is the annual cost of the loan, including principal and interest.
	
Generally, a lender wants to see a DSCR of greater than 1.0, with most requiring at least 1.25. A DSCR of 1.25 means the property's income is 25% higher than what's needed to cover the mortgage payments, providing a comfortable cushion for the lender.

This type of loan is a game-changer for real estate investors who may not qualify for conventional loans due to a complex financial profile, like being self-employed or having multiple properties that make their personal DTI ratio look high. Instead of focusing on your personal financial story, the loan is approved based on the strength of the asset itself.

Interpreting Your DSCR
DSCR < 1: The company's operating income is not enough to cover its total debt obligations. 
DSCR = 1: The company's operating income is just enough to cover its total debt obligations. 
DSCR > 1: The company has enough operating income to cover its debt obligations, with a cushion of cash. Lenders often prefer a DSCR above 1.25x, and the higher the ratio, the better.

-> DSCR in mortgages stands for **Debt Service Coverage Ratio**.

### 1. **Definition**

* DSCR measures how much **net operating income (NOI)** a property generates relative to its debt obligations (the mortgage payment).
* Formula:

  
  DSCR = Net Operating Income √∑ Debt Service (Mortgage Principal + Interest)
  
* Example: If a rental property earns $10,000/month in net income and the mortgage costs $8,000/month,

  $$
  DSCR = 10,000 / 8,000 = 1.25
  
  $$

  ‚Üí This means the property earns 25% more than needed to cover its debt.

### 2. **Why It Matters**

* Lenders use DSCR to determine whether **income from the property** is enough to cover the mortgage without relying on the borrower‚Äôs personal income.
* A higher DSCR = lower risk for the lender.
* Common requirement: **1.20‚Äì1.25+ DSCR** for approval, though some programs allow lower (like 1.0 or even 0.75 with higher down payments).

---

### 3. **Is DSCR only for investment properties?**

* **Yes, in practice.**
  DSCR loans are designed **for investment or rental properties** (residential or commercial).

  * Example: rental homes, multi-family apartments, office buildings, etc.
* For **owner-occupied primary residences**, lenders usually don‚Äôt use DSCR. Instead, they look at **DTI (Debt-to-Income ratio)**, which measures the borrower‚Äôs personal income vs. personal debts.

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
DSCR = Net Operating Income √∑ Mortgage Debt Service.
It‚Äôs mainly used for **investment property loans**, where the property‚Äôs income‚Äînot your personal income‚Äîis used to qualify. For your own home, lenders look at **DTI**, not DSCR.

-> A **Non-QM program** (short for **Non‚ÄìQualified Mortgage program**) is a type of mortgage that **doesn‚Äôt meet the CFPB‚Äôs ‚ÄúQualified Mortgage‚Äù (QM) rules** under the Dodd-Frank Act.

---

### üîπ 1. **Qualified Mortgage (QM) Basics**

A **QM loan** follows strict federal rules meant to ensure the borrower can repay. For example:

* Max **DTI (Debt-to-Income)** ratio (usually 43% cap).
* No risky features (interest-only, negative amortization, balloon payments).
* Income and employment must be **fully documented** (W-2s, tax returns, pay stubs).
* Underwritten to **Ability-to-Repay (ATR)** standards.

---

### üîπ 2. **Non-QM Mortgage**

A **Non-QM loan** breaks out of those strict guidelines.

* Still a **legal, safe loan**, but it doesn‚Äôt fit the ‚ÄúQualified‚Äù box.
* Lenders can set their **own guidelines**, but usually require larger down payments and charge higher interest rates because risk is higher.

---

### üîπ 3. **Who Uses Non-QM Loans?**

* **Self-employed borrowers**: use **bank statements**, not W-2s/tax returns, to prove income.
* **Real estate investors**: qualify using **DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)**, where property income qualifies instead of personal income.
* **Borrowers with recent credit events** (bankruptcy, foreclosure, short sale).
* **High-net-worth borrowers** who prefer **asset depletion loans** (qualify based on savings/investments).
* **Borrowers with high DTIs** beyond the 43% QM limit.

---

### üîπ 4. **Examples of Non-QM Programs**

* **Bank Statement Loan** (12‚Äì24 months deposits prove income).
* **DSCR Loan** (rental property income only).
* **Interest-Only Loan** (allowed in Non-QM).
* **Foreign National Loan** (for non-U.S. residents buying U.S. property).
* **Asset-Based Loan** (use investments/savings as income stream).

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**
A **Non-QM program** is a mortgage option for borrowers who don‚Äôt fit traditional lending rules (QM). It‚Äôs popular with **self-employed, investors, or people with unique financial situations**.
