-> In mortgage pricing and loan programs, "30-year agency enhanced loan program" typically refers to a 30-year fixed-rate loan offered by or conforming to government-backed agencies like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

The “enhanced” part often means:

Special eligibility (e.g., first-time homebuyers, low-income borrowers)
Reduced pricing add-ons
Expanded eligibility criteria

Application Products (FA30, FR30, FAHB30, FRHB30):

These are short codes used by lenders/investors to designate specific loan products:

FA30
FA = Fixed Agency
30 = 30-year term
➡️ Fixed-rate agency 30-year loan

FR30
FR = Fixed Rate
30 = 30-year term
➡️ Fixed-rate 30-year loan

FAHB30
FAHB = Fixed Agency Homebuyer
30 = 30-year term
➡️ Fixed-rate 30-year loan for homebuyers (first-time or special program eligibility)

FRHB30
FRHB = Fixed Rate Homebuyer
30 = 30-year term
➡️ Fixed-rate 30-year loan for homebuyers (like FAHB30 but possibly a different delivery channel or investor guideline)

-> 30-Year Jumbo AUS

Loan term: 30 years.

✅ Jumbo

The loan amount exceeds the conforming loan limits (like those set by Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac).

It’s for higher loan amounts that don’t qualify for conforming conventional programs.

✅ AUS

DU (Desktop Underwriter) – Fannie Mae

For Jumbo loans, some lenders have internal AUS-like tools to assess risk and eligibility.
