PASS IF:

    Lock Request is submitted, and the current date/time is IN ( Seller Settings - Lock Desk Hours ) and NOT IN (the Global Settings - Lock Desk Hours)
	AND  The Sum of Commitment Loan Balance from the current date with lock date/time IN (Seller Settings - Lock Desk Hours ) and NOT IN (Global Settings - Lock Desk Hours ) from Aggregate Pipeline Data < Seller Settings - Overnight Lock Limit
     OR Seller Settings - Overnight Commitment Limit = NULL.

ELSE FAIL



Explanation of the Rule:

This rule is designed to determine whether a mortgage lock request should be approved based on certain conditions involving timing, commitment loan balances, and the seller's specific settings.
Conditions for PASS (approval):

    Lock Request is submitted:

        A request is made to lock the interest rate for a mortgage.

    Condition 1: Current date/time is within Seller Settings - Lock Desk Hours, but not within Global Settings - Lock Desk Hours:

        Seller Settings - Lock Desk Hours: These are the hours set by the seller during which they accept lock requests.

        Global Settings - Lock Desk Hours: These are the general lock hours set across the entire system or organization, not specific to one seller.

        The current date/time must be within the Seller Settings - Lock Desk Hours, but NOT within the Global Settings - Lock Desk Hours. This ensures that lock requests are processed only during the seller's allowed hours and are not restricted by the global lock desk hours.

    Condition 2: The Sum of Commitment Loan Balance from the current date with lock date/time within Seller Settings - Lock Desk Hours, but not within Global Settings - Lock Desk Hours, and from Aggregate Pipeline Data is less than Seller Settings - Overnight Lock Limit:

        Sum of Commitment Loan Balance: This refers to the total loan amount that has been committed (agreed upon) by the lender.

        Aggregate Pipeline Data: This represents the total loan data across all active loans in the pipeline.

        The total sum of the committed loan balance for the current date and time (factoring in the seller's lock hours) should be less than the Seller Settings - Overnight Lock Limit. This ensures that the seller does not exceed their allowed overnight commitment limit.

    Condition 3: Seller Settings - Overnight Commitment Limit = NULL:

        If the seller has not set an Overnight Commitment Limit (i.e., this value is NULL), the condition passes automatically. This means that if no limit is defined, the lock request will not be restricted by any overnight commitment limits.

ELSE FAIL (rejection):

    If any one of the conditions is not met (i.e., the lock request falls outside the seller's allowed lock hours, or the commitment balance exceeds the overnight limit), the lock request will fail (i.e., it will be rejected).

Summary of the Rule:

    The lock request is approved (PASS) if:

        The current date/time is within the Seller's Lock Desk Hours but not within the Global Lock Desk Hours.

        The total commitment loan balance (for the current date and lock time) is less than the Seller's Overnight Lock Limit, or if the Overnight Commitment Limit is NULL (no limit is set).

    If any condition is not satisfied (e.g., lock hours or limit exceeded), the lock request is rejected (FAIL).

To model and implement the given requirement in your Spring-based Java application for the mortgage pricing engine, you need to follow a structured approach that separates concerns and maintains flexibility. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to design the solution and implement it in a Spring Boot application.
Step 1: Understanding the Requirements

The requirement involves multiple conditions:

    Lock Request Validation: This is based on whether the current date/time falls within the seller's lock desk hours and not within the global lock desk hours.

    Commitment Loan Balance Check: The sum of the commitment loan balance from the current date and lock date/time must be less than the seller's overnight lock limit, unless the overnight commitment limit is NULL.

    Logical Operations: The two conditions should be logically combined using AND and OR operators, meaning if the first condition fails, we check the second condition for the sum of commitment loan balance or the overnight limit being NULL.

Step 2: Domain Classes

You need to create domain classes representing the data that will be used in this rule. These include classes for SellerSettings, GlobalSettings, and AggregatePipelineData.
1. SellerSettings Class

This class holds settings related to the seller such as lock desk hours, overnight lock limits, etc.

public class SellerSettings {
    private List<LocalDateTime> lockDeskHours;    // Lock desk hours
    private Double overnightLockLimit;            // Overnight lock limit
    private Double overnightCommitmentLimit;      // Overnight commitment limit

    // Getters and Setters
}

2. GlobalSettings Class

This class holds the global settings for lock desk hours and any global conditions.

public class GlobalSettings {
    private List<LocalDateTime> lockDeskHours;    // Global lock desk hours

    // Getters and Setters
}

3. AggregatePipelineData Class

This class holds data from the aggregate pipeline such as the commitment loan balance.

public class AggregatePipelineData {
    private Double commitmentLoanBalance;   // Sum of commitment loan balance

    // Getters and Setters
}

Step 3: Implementing the Rule Logic

You can now implement the rule logic in a service that will encapsulate the business rules.
1. LockRequestRule Class

This class will have a method that checks the conditions as per the given requirement.

import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.util.List;

public class LockRequestRule {

    public boolean isLockRequestValid(LocalDateTime currentDateTime,
                                      SellerSettings sellerSettings,
                                      GlobalSettings globalSettings,
                                      AggregatePipelineData aggregateData) {
        boolean isWithinLockHours = isWithinLockHours(currentDateTime, sellerSettings, globalSettings);
        boolean isCommitmentValid = isCommitmentBalanceValid(aggregateData, sellerSettings);

        return isWithinLockHours && isCommitmentValid;
    }

    private boolean isWithinLockHours(LocalDateTime currentDateTime,
                                      SellerSettings sellerSettings,
                                      GlobalSettings globalSettings) {
        boolean isInSellerLockHours = sellerSettings.getLockDeskHours().contains(currentDateTime);
        boolean isNotInGlobalLockHours = !globalSettings.getLockDeskHours().contains(currentDateTime);

        return isInSellerLockHours && isNotInGlobalLockHours;
    }

    private boolean isCommitmentBalanceValid(AggregatePipelineData aggregateData, SellerSettings sellerSettings) {
        if (sellerSettings.getOvernightCommitmentLimit() == null) {
            return true;  // Valid if the overnight limit is NULL
        }
        return aggregateData.getCommitmentLoanBalance() < sellerSettings.getOvernightCommitmentLimit();
    }
}

Step 4: Service Layer for Rule Execution

Next, create a service class that invokes the rule and determines whether the request passes or fails based on the business rules.
1. MortgagePricingService Class

This service will process the lock request and apply the validation rule.

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@Service
public class MortgagePricingService {

    private final LockRequestRule lockRequestRule;

    public MortgagePricingService(LockRequestRule lockRequestRule) {
        this.lockRequestRule = lockRequestRule;
    }

    public String processLockRequest(LocalDateTime currentDateTime,
                                      SellerSettings sellerSettings,
                                      GlobalSettings globalSettings,
                                      AggregatePipelineData aggregateData) {
        // Check lock request validity
        boolean isLockRequestValid = lockRequestRule.isLockRequestValid(currentDateTime, 
                                                                      sellerSettings, 
                                                                      globalSettings, 
                                                                      aggregateData);
        if (isLockRequestValid) {
            return "PASS";
        } else {
            return "FAIL";
        }
    }
}

Step 5: Controller Layer to Expose the Logic via REST API

Create a controller to expose this rule processing as a REST endpoint so that the frontend or other systems can interact with the mortgage pricing engine.
1. MortgageController Class

This controller receives the lock request and returns whether it passes or fails based on the conditions.

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/mortgage")
public class MortgageController {

    private final MortgagePricingService mortgagePricingService;

    public MortgageController(MortgagePricingService mortgagePricingService) {
        this.mortgagePricingService = mortgagePricingService;
    }

    @PostMapping("/processLockRequest")
    public String processLockRequest(@RequestBody LockRequestRequest request) {
        return mortgagePricingService.processLockRequest(
            request.getCurrentDateTime(),
            request.getSellerSettings(),
            request.getGlobalSettings(),
            request.getAggregatePipelineData()
        );
    }
}

Step 6: LockRequestRequest DTO

You can use a DTO (Data Transfer Object) for the lock request data, which will be used in the request body.

public class LockRequestRequest {
    private LocalDateTime currentDateTime;
    private SellerSettings sellerSettings;
    private GlobalSettings globalSettings;
    private AggregatePipelineData aggregatePipelineData;

    // Getters and Setters
}

Step 7: Testing the Logic

You will need to test the logic to ensure that it works as expected. You can use JUnit and Mockito to write unit tests for the MortgagePricingService and LockRequestRule.
Example Unit Test:

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import org.mockito.Mockito;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class MortgagePricingServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private LockRequestRule lockRequestRule;

    @Test
    public void testProcessLockRequest() {
        // Setup mock data
        LocalDateTime currentDateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
        SellerSettings sellerSettings = new SellerSettings();
        GlobalSettings globalSettings = new GlobalSettings();
        AggregatePipelineData aggregateData = new AggregatePipelineData();

        // Setup mock behavior for LockRequestRule
        Mockito.when(lockRequestRule.isLockRequestValid(Mockito.any(), Mockito.any(), Mockito.any(), Mockito.any()))
               .thenReturn(true);  // Simulating a valid lock request

        // Call service method
        MortgagePricingService service = new MortgagePricingService(lockRequestRule);
        String result = service.processLockRequest(currentDateTime, sellerSettings, globalSettings, aggregateData);

        // Assert the result
        assertEquals("PASS", result);
    }
}

Step 8: Enhancements and Flexibility

As the business logic for mortgage pricing evolves, consider using a rule engine (like Drools) to dynamically manage and evaluate rules. This would allow non-developers to change rules without modifying the codebase, providing greater flexibility.
Conclusion

The above steps break down the requirement into manageable components and provide a Spring-based Java solution. You can implement the rule using domain models, a service layer for applying logic, and a controller to expose the functionality. This setup provides a clear and flexible way to implement and extend the mortgage pricing engine.
