"matchAction": {

If it doesn't match, it defaults to Pass.






"expressions": [
  {
    "expressionText": "interest_rate_type <> 'Fixed'"
  },
  {
    "expressionText": "loan_purpose IN ('RefiCashOut', 'RefiRateTerm')"
  },
  {
    "expressionText": "property_state = 'TX'"
  },
  {
    "expressionText": "loan_term < 240"
  }
]


These are the conditions to be evaluated:

Interest rate type is not fixed.

Loan purpose is one of RefiCashOut or RefiRateTerm.

Property is located in Texas (TX).

Summary:
This JSON defines a loan rule that checks:

If the interest rate is not fixed,

And the loan purpose is refinancing,

And the property is in Texas,

And the loan term is less than 20 years,

Then mark the application as ineligible (Fail). Otherwise, pass it.
