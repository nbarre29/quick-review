🔍 What is ThirtyDayAverageSOFR?

Thirty Day Average SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is:

    A 30-day compounded average of the SOFR rate.

    SOFR is a benchmark interest rate published by the New York Federal Reserve.

    It has replaced LIBOR as the preferred benchmark for ARMs in the U.S.

    The 30-day average smooths out daily fluctuations, making it more stable for loan adjustments.

🏠 In Mortgage Terms:

    It is the base index used to adjust the interest rate on an ARM.

    The borrower’s rate = 30-day SOFR average + margin.

    It's commonly used by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and private investors for:

        Pricing ARM products

        Performing periodic interest rate resets

🧠 Example:

If:

    ThirtyDayAverageSOFR = 5.20%

    Margin = 2.00%

Then:

    New ARM rate = 7.20%, subject to caps and floors.
