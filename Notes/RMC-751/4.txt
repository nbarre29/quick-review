🔁 ARMIndex armIndex;

    The benchmark index used to adjust the interest rate over time.

    Common indexes: SOFR, LIBOR (phased out), Treasury, CMT, COFI.

    The interest rate is calculated as:
    index + margin

📈 BigDecimal interestRateInitialAdjustmentCap;

    Cap on how much the interest rate can change at the first adjustment (e.g., after 5 years on a 5/1 ARM).

    Example: If initial rate is 3% and cap is 2%, the new rate can't exceed 5%.

🔁 BigDecimal interestRatePeriodicAdjustmentCap;

    The max change in interest rate at each subsequent adjustment period (typically yearly).

    Helps limit payment shock after the initial adjustment.

🔒 BigDecimal interestRateLifetimeCap;

    The maximum rate the loan can ever reach over its lifetime, regardless of how high the index rises.

    Example: Lifetime cap of 5% on a starting rate of 3% = max rate of 8%.

⬇️ BigDecimal interestRateFloor;

    The minimum interest rate the loan can ever fall to, no matter how low the index gets.

    Protects the lender from negative or near-zero rates.

➕ BigDecimal margin;

    The fixed percentage added to the index to determine the fully indexed rate.

    Example:
    If index = 2.5% and margin = 2.0% → Rate = 4.5%
