🏦 In mortgage terms:

    Special rules apply when borrowers in Texas take out equity from their primary residence.

    Maximum LTV is 80%, and only one equity loan is allowed at a time.

    Certain closing disclosures and waiting periods apply.

    Pricing engines usually add overlays for:

        LTV restrictions

        Rate hits

2️ EscrowHoldBack

    A condition where part of the loan funds are held back in escrow until certain work is completed.

    A portion of funds is withheld, and released after verification of completion.

    Impacts pricing or eligibility depending on:

        Lender policy

        Property type

        Investor rules

3️ TemporaryBuyDown

    A temporary reduction in the borrower's interest rate for the first 1–3 years.

🧮 Examples:

    2-1 Buydown: 2% lower rate in Year 1, 1% lower in Year 2, then full rate in Year 3.

    3-2-1 Buydown: Decreases for 3 years, then fixed.

💵 Who pays for it?

    Often seller- or builder-paid as a concession.

    May affect LLPAs (Loan Level Price Adjustments) or discount points in pricing engines.

    May trigger overlays for:

        Minimum credit score
