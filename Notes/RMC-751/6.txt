💡 What is AmortizationType in Mortgage Terminology?

AmortizationType refers to how the loan’s principal and interest are structured and paid off over time. It describes the method by which a borrower's mortgage loan balance is reduced.
🔑 Common AmortizationType Values and Their Meaning:

    Fixed

        Regular payments remain the same throughout the loan term.

        Fully amortized — principal and interest are fully paid off by the end.

        Example: 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.

    ARM (Adjustable-Rate Mortgage)

        Interest rate adjusts periodically after an initial fixed period.

        Payments may change over time.

        Typically amortized over 30 years.

    InterestOnly

        Borrower pays only the interest for a set period (e.g., 5 or 10 years).

        Principal remains unchanged during the interest-only period.

        Afterward, the loan re-amortizes, and payments increase to include principal.

    Balloon

        Smaller payments initially, with a large final balloon payment at the end.

        Often used in commercial or short-term loans.

        Not fully amortized — requires a lump sum payoff.

    NegativeAmortization

        Monthly payment is less than the interest accrued ("Accrued" means something has accumulated over time but has not yet been paid or received. ), so the unpaid interest is added to the balance.

        Loan balance grows over time.
		

🏦 Why It Matters in Mortgage Pricing Engines:

    Determines how monthly payments are calculated.

    Influences eligibility, pricing, and risk exposure.

    Certain investors or agencies restrict support for non-standard amortization types (e.g., NegativeAmortization).
