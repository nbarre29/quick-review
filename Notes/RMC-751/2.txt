ProgramType.java


Here's an explanation of the ProgramType enum values in the context of mortgage pricing — each representing a type of loan program:
🏛️ 1. Agency

    Loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

    Must meet conforming loan limits and underwriting standards.

    Often the baseline for pricing models.

🏠 2. Conforming

    A type of Agency loan that meets the limits set by FHFA (e.g., loan amount, DTI, FICO).

    Eligible for sale to Fannie/Freddie.

    Lower risk = better pricing (lower rates).

🏛️ 3. FHA (Federal Housing Administration)

    Government-insured loan for low-to-moderate-income borrowers.

    Lower credit score and down payment requirements.

    Priced with upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums (UFMIP, MIP).

🪖 4. VA (Veterans Affairs)

    Loan guaranteed by the VA for eligible veterans and service members.

    No down payment or mortgage insurance.

    Typically very competitive rates and fee structures.

🌾 5. USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture)

    Government-backed loan for rural and suburban areas.

    Income and location restrictions apply.

    Often zero down payment and subsidized pricing.

💰 6. Jumbo

    Loans that exceed conforming loan limits.

    Not eligible for sale to Fannie/Freddie.

    Priced with higher rates due to greater risk and less liquidity.

🧾 7. NonQM (Non-Qualified Mortgage)

    Does not meet the CFPB's Qualified Mortgage (QM) rules.

    Used for borrowers with:

        Alternative income (e.g., bank statements, 1099s)

        High debt ratios

        Recent credit events

    Higher rates, more flexible underwriting.

🔁 8. HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit)

    A revolving line of credit secured by the borrower’s home.

    Often second lien position.

    Variable rate product, not always priced via standard rate sheets.

🏦 9. ClosedEndSecond

    A fixed-term second mortgage, not revolving.

    Lump-sum disbursed upfront, repaid over time.

    Can be used alongside a first mortgage (e.g., piggyback loans).

❓ 10. Other

    Catch-all for loan programs that don’t fit above categories.

    Could include reverse mortgages, portfolio products, etc.
