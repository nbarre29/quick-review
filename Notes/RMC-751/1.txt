explain above in mortgage pricing


In mortgage pricing and secondary markets, the term TradeType refers to how loans are committed or sold to investors. Each type defines how pricing, risk, and delivery are handled.

Here’s a breakdown of the three TradeType values you mentioned:
1️ AggregateBulk

    Definition: A bulk commitment of multiple loans combined together into a single trade, based on total volume.

🔍 Characteristics:

    Loans are grouped and priced in aggregate — not individually.

    Usually used by lenders with moderate to large volume.

    The trade is evaluated on the total characteristics (e.g., average rate, coupon, FICO, LTV).

    No need to lock each loan individually upfront — pricing is given for the pool.

    Common with mandatory delivery.

🏦 Example:

    A lender commits to deliver $10M in conforming loans by the end of the month. Individual loans may vary, but must conform to agreed pool specs.

2️ LoanLevelBulk

    Definition: A bulk trade where each loan is individually priced and committed, but sent together as a batch.

🔍 Characteristics:

    Each loan has its own lock, rate, and pricing.

    Still delivered as part of a bulk pool for operational or pricing purposes.

    Allows more granularity and control per loan than AggregateBulk.

    Common with pipeline hedging strategies.

🏦 Example:

    Ten loans are priced and committed individually, but sent as a combined commitment to an aggregator or investor.

3️ BestEfforts

    Definition: A commitment to try to deliver a loan by a certain date — but if it falls through, there's no penalty.

🔍 Characteristics:

    Loan-level commitments only.

    Lender gets a rate/price quote and commits only if they fund the loan.

    If the borrower backs out or fails to close, the lender is not penalized.

    Generally worse pricing than bulk/mandatory (due to investor risk).

    Ideal for small lenders or retail-focused channels.

🏦 Example:

    A borrower locks a rate. The lender gets a Best Efforts quote. If the loan doesn’t fund, no pair-off fee is charged.
	



Summary Comparison:

📦 AggregateBulk

    Pricing Scope: Based on the total pool of loans.

    Commitment Risk: Mandatory delivery — you must fulfill the trade.

    Pricing Flexibility: Less flexible, since pricing applies to the combined pool characteristics.

    Use Case: Best suited for larger lenders with high volume who can commit to delivering a block of loans as a unit.

🧮 LoanLevelBulk

    Pricing Scope: Applies to individual loans, even though they’re grouped for delivery.

    Commitment Risk: Still mandatory, but at the individual loan level.

    Pricing Flexibility: Moderate flexibility, since each loan is priced and locked separately.

    Use Case: Ideal for lenders focused on hedging strategies and pipeline control.

🤝 BestEfforts

    Pricing Scope: Applies to individual loans.

    Commitment Risk: No penalty if the loan doesn’t close.

    Pricing Flexibility: Highly flexible, offering rate protection without delivery obligation.

    Use Case: Preferred by small lenders or brokers with low volume and limited risk tolerance.
