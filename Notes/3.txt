PASS IF:

    Lock Request is requested for a Product ID where Product-Automated Exception Approvals = YES

    AND the Seller-Automated Exception Approvals = YES

    AND the Global-Automated Exception Approvals = YES

    AND [Eligibility Rules Output indicates > 0 rules with Refer result]
	
	AND [Eligibility Rules Output indicates  0 rules with FAIL result]

    AND [Eligibility Rules Output indicates *need to define how sufficient exception overrides will be structured*]


ELSE FAIL



Explanation of the Rule:

This rule is designed to evaluate whether a mortgage lock request should be approved when exceptions are involved. It includes conditions related to automated exception approvals at the product, seller, and global levels, along with the outcome of eligibility rules.
Conditions for PASS (approval):

    Lock Request is requested for a Product ID where:

        Product-Automated Exception Approvals = YES:

            The product allows automated exception approvals, meaning the system can automatically approve exceptions for this product without manual review.

    Seller-Automated Exception Approvals = YES:

        The seller has configured the system to allow automated exception approvals. This means the seller has set up the ability to approve exceptions automatically.

    Global-Automated Exception Approvals = YES:

        The global system allows automated exception approvals for all sellers and products. If this is YES, then automated exception handling is enabled at the global level.

    Eligibility Rules Output indicates > 0 rules with Refer result:

        Eligibility Rules are a set of predefined rules that determine whether the lock request is eligible. The system checks if more than 0 rules indicate a Refer result. A Refer result typically indicates that the request requires further review or attention, but is still eligible for approval under the right conditions.

    Eligibility Rules Output indicates 0 rules with FAIL result:

        The system checks if 0 rules indicate a FAIL result. A FAIL result means the request does not meet the eligibility criteria. This condition ensures that no rule has failed, indicating that the request is still eligible for approval.

    Eligibility Rules Output indicates "need to define how sufficient exception overrides will be structured":

        This condition checks that the system recognizes that exception overrides (rules that allow the system to make exceptions) have not yet been sufficiently defined. Essentially, the system is checking that there is an understanding or plan in place for handling exceptions properly, which may require manual definition.

ELSE FAIL (rejection):

    If any one of the conditions is not met (i.e., if any automated exception approval setting is OFF, any eligibility rule fails, or exceptions are not sufficiently defined), the lock request fails, meaning it will not be approved automatically.

Summary of the Rule:

    The lock request is approved (PASS) if:

        Product, Seller, and Global settings all allow automated exception approvals.

        The eligibility rules output indicates:

            More than 0 rules with a Refer result.

            0 rules with a FAIL result.

            There is an understanding or need to define how exception overrides will be structured.

    If any of these conditions are not met, the lock request is rejected (FAIL). This ensures that only requests that meet specific exception handling criteria are approved.

I'm developing a java application in spring for Mortgage pricing engine for the above mentioned requirement. Explain how to model and implement it



To implement the rule you've described in your Spring-based Java application for the mortgage pricing engine, we need to follow a structured approach to model the data and implement the business logic. Here's a step-by-step guide to how you can model and implement the rule effectively:
Step 1: Understanding the Requirements

The rule involves several conditions:

    Automated Exception Approvals: This should be "YES" in the Product, Seller, and Global settings.

    Eligibility Rules Output: It needs to indicate:

        > 0 rules with "Refer" result

        0 rules with "FAIL" result

        A need to define how sufficient exception overrides will be structured

If all these conditions are met, the result should be "PASS"; otherwise, it should be "FAIL".
Step 2: Define Domain Classes

To handle this logic, you need domain classes for Product, SellerSettings, GlobalSettings, and EligibilityRulesOutput. These classes will hold the necessary data for rule validation.
1. Product Class

This class represents the product associated with the lock request and its automated exception approval setting.

public class Product {
    private String productId;
    private boolean automatedExceptionApprovals;  // YES or NO

    // Getters and Setters
}

2. SellerSettings Class

This class holds the seller’s automated exception approval setting.

public class SellerSettings {
    private boolean automatedExceptionApprovals;  // YES or NO

    // Getters and Setters
}

3. GlobalSettings Class

This class holds the global settings for automated exception approvals.

public class GlobalSettings {
    private boolean automatedExceptionApprovals;  // YES or NO

    // Getters and Setters
}

4. EligibilityRulesOutput Class

This class holds the output of the eligibility rules, including the results of rules such as "Refer", "FAIL", and exception overrides.

public class EligibilityRulesOutput {
    private int referCount;   // Number of rules with "Refer" result
    private int failCount;    // Number of rules with "FAIL" result
    private boolean sufficientExceptionOverridesDefined;

    // Getters and Setters
}

5. LockRequest Class

This class represents the lock request, containing the product, seller settings, global settings, and eligibility rules output.

public class LockRequest {
    private Product product;
    private SellerSettings sellerSettings;
    private GlobalSettings globalSettings;
    private EligibilityRulesOutput eligibilityRulesOutput;

    // Getters and Setters
}

Step 3: Implementing the Rule Logic

Now, let's implement the rule logic in a class. This class will check if all the conditions for a valid lock request are met.
LockRequestRule Class

This class contains the logic for checking the conditions:

public class LockRequestRule {

    public boolean isLockRequestValid(LockRequest lockRequest) {
        // Check if all the conditions are met for a valid lock request
        boolean isAutomatedExceptionApprovalValid = isAutomatedExceptionApprovalsValid(lockRequest);
        boolean isEligibilityRulesValid = isEligibilityRulesValid(lockRequest.getEligibilityRulesOutput());

        return isAutomatedExceptionApprovalValid && isEligibilityRulesValid;
    }

    private boolean isAutomatedExceptionApprovalsValid(LockRequest lockRequest) {
        // Check if Product, Seller, and Global settings all have automated exception approvals as YES
        return lockRequest.getProduct().isAutomatedExceptionApprovals() &&
               lockRequest.getSellerSettings().isAutomatedExceptionApprovals() &&
               lockRequest.getGlobalSettings().isAutomatedExceptionApprovals();
    }

    private boolean isEligibilityRulesValid(EligibilityRulesOutput eligibilityRulesOutput) {
        // Check if the Eligibility Rules Output meets all conditions
        return eligibilityRulesOutput.getReferCount() > 0 &&
               eligibilityRulesOutput.getFailCount() == 0 &&
               eligibilityRulesOutput.isSufficientExceptionOverridesDefined();
    }
}

Step 4: Service Layer for Rule Execution

The service layer will orchestrate the application of the rule. It will call the LockRequestRule class to validate the lock request.
MortgagePricingService Class

This service will process the lock request and use the rule validation logic:

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MortgagePricingService {

    private final LockRequestRule lockRequestRule;

    public MortgagePricingService(LockRequestRule lockRequestRule) {
        this.lockRequestRule = lockRequestRule;
    }

    public String processLockRequest(LockRequest lockRequest) {
        // Check if lock request is valid based on the rule
        boolean isLockRequestValid = lockRequestRule.isLockRequestValid(lockRequest);
        if (isLockRequestValid) {
            return "PASS";
        } else {
            return "FAIL";
        }
    }
}

Step 5: Expose the Logic via REST API

Create a REST controller to expose the logic so users can submit lock requests and get the results.
MortgageController Class

This controller will receive the lock request and process it using the MortgagePricingService.

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/mortgage")
public class MortgageController {

    private final MortgagePricingService mortgagePricingService;

    public MortgageController(MortgagePricingService mortgagePricingService) {
        this.mortgagePricingService = mortgagePricingService;
    }

    @PostMapping("/processLockRequest")
    public String processLockRequest(@RequestBody LockRequest lockRequest) {
        return mortgagePricingService.processLockRequest(lockRequest);
    }
}

Step 6: Example Data in the Controller

When submitting a POST request, the body will include all the necessary data for the lock request. Here's an example of the request body:

{
  "product": {
    "productId": "12345",
    "automatedExceptionApprovals": true
  },
  "sellerSettings": {
    "automatedExceptionApprovals": true
  },
  "globalSettings": {
    "automatedExceptionApprovals": true
  },
  "eligibilityRulesOutput": {
    "referCount": 1,
    "failCount": 0,
    "sufficientExceptionOverridesDefined": true
  }
}

Step 7: Unit Testing the Logic

You should write unit tests to ensure the business logic is correctly implemented. Here’s an example unit test for MortgagePricingService:
Example Unit Test:

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class MortgagePricingServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private LockRequestRule lockRequestRule;

    @Test
    public void testProcessLockRequest() {
        // Setup mock data
        Product product = new Product();
        product.setAutomatedExceptionApprovals(true);

        SellerSettings sellerSettings = new SellerSettings();
        sellerSettings.setAutomatedExceptionApprovals(true);

        GlobalSettings globalSettings = new GlobalSettings();
        globalSettings.setAutomatedExceptionApprovals(true);

        EligibilityRulesOutput eligibilityRulesOutput = new EligibilityRulesOutput();
        eligibilityRulesOutput.setReferCount(1);
        eligibilityRulesOutput.setFailCount(0);
        eligibilityRulesOutput.setSufficientExceptionOverridesDefined(true);

        LockRequest lockRequest = new LockRequest();
        lockRequest.setProduct(product);
        lockRequest.setSellerSettings(sellerSettings);
        lockRequest.setGlobalSettings(globalSettings);
        lockRequest.setEligibilityRulesOutput(eligibilityRulesOutput);

        // Setup mock behavior for LockRequestRule
        when(lockRequestRule.isLockRequestValid(lockRequest)).thenReturn(true);  // Simulating a valid lock request

        // Create the service and call the method
        MortgagePricingService service = new MortgagePricingService(lockRequestRule);
        String result = service.processLockRequest(lockRequest);

        // Assert the result
        assertEquals("PASS", result);
    }
}

Step 8: Enhancements and Flexibility

As your system evolves, you may want to add more complex rules or exceptions. You could also consider:

    Using a rule engine like Drools for more flexibility in defining and modifying rules without code changes.

    Implementing logging and auditing to track which requests pass or fail and why.

Conclusion

The provided solution is structured into manageable parts: domain classes for holding the necessary data, a rule class for evaluating the conditions, a service class to process the business logic, and a controller to expose the functionality via REST. This approach makes it easy to extend the logic, maintain the application, and integrate with other parts of your mortgage pricing engine.
