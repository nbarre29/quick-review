PASS IF:

    Lock Request is submitted for a Product ID where Product-Automated Lock Approvals = ON
	AND the Seller Settings - Automated Lock Approvals = ON
	AND the Global - Automated Lock Approvals is ON.

ELSE FAIL


Explanation of the Rule:

This rule is designed to determine whether a mortgage lock request for a specific product is approved based on the automated lock approval settings at the product, seller, and global levels.
Conditions for PASS (approval):

    Lock Request is submitted for a Product ID: A request to lock the mortgage rate is made for a specific product identified by its Product ID.

    Condition 1: Product-Automated Lock Approvals = ON:

        This means that the product in question has automated lock approvals enabled. If this setting is ON, the system will automatically approve the lock request for that specific product, provided the other conditions are met.

    Condition 2: Seller Settings - Automated Lock Approvals = ON:

        This indicates that the seller has enabled automated lock approvals in their settings. If this setting is ON, the seller will allow lock requests to be automatically approved for products that are eligible, based on the seller's criteria.

    Condition 3: Global - Automated Lock Approvals = ON:

        This refers to a global setting that applies across all sellers and products in the system. If this setting is ON, it means that automated lock approvals are permitted globally, allowing the system to approve lock requests without manual intervention across the entire system.

ELSE FAIL (rejection):

    If any one of these conditions is not met (i.e., any setting is OFF or not enabled), the lock request will fail, meaning it will not be approved automatically.

Summary of the Rule:

    The lock request is approved (PASS) if:

        The product has automated lock approvals enabled.

        The seller has automated lock approvals enabled.

        The global system allows automated lock approvals.

    If any of these settings is disabled (OFF), the request is rejected (FAIL).

I'm developing a java application in spring for Mortgage pricing engine for the above mentioned requirement. Explain how to model and implement it



To model and implement the provided requirement in your Spring-based Java application for the mortgage pricing engine, you need to break down the rule into logical steps. Here's a structured approach to how you can design and implement it:
Step 1: Understanding the Requirement

The requirement involves checking the following conditions for a lock request:

    Product Automated Lock Approvals: This must be "ON".

    Seller Settings Automated Lock Approvals: This must also be "ON".

    Global Automated Lock Approvals: This must also be "ON".

If all the above conditions are satisfied, the result should be "PASS", otherwise, it should be "FAIL".
Step 2: Define Domain Classes

You will need domain classes to represent the Product, SellerSettings, and GlobalSettings, each of which holds relevant settings for the conditions.
1. Product Class

This class represents the product being processed in the lock request.

public class Product {
    private String productId;
    private boolean automatedLockApprovals;

    // Getters and Setters
}

2. SellerSettings Class

This class holds the sellerâ€™s configuration, including the automated lock approval setting.

public class SellerSettings {
    private boolean automatedLockApprovals;

    // Getters and Setters
}

3. GlobalSettings Class

This class holds global settings, including whether automated lock approvals are turned on.

public class GlobalSettings {
    private boolean automatedLockApprovals;

    // Getters and Setters
}

4. LockRequest Class

This class will represent a lock request which contains the necessary information to evaluate the rule (such as Product, SellerSettings, and GlobalSettings).

public class LockRequest {
    private Product product;
    private SellerSettings sellerSettings;
    private GlobalSettings globalSettings;

    // Getters and Setters
}

Step 3: Implement Rule Logic

You need to implement the rule logic to evaluate whether all the required conditions are satisfied.
LockRequestRule Class

This class will contain the logic to check the conditions for the lock request.

public class LockRequestRule {

    public boolean isLockRequestValid(LockRequest lockRequest) {
        // Check if all the conditions are met for a valid lock request
        return lockRequest.getProduct().isAutomatedLockApprovals() &&
               lockRequest.getSellerSettings().isAutomatedLockApprovals() &&
               lockRequest.getGlobalSettings().isAutomatedLockApprovals();
    }
}

Step 4: Service Layer for Rule Execution

Create a service that orchestrates the rule validation. This service will call the LockRequestRule class to check whether the lock request passes the conditions.
MortgagePricingService Class

This service processes the lock request and checks the validity using the LockRequestRule.

import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MortgagePricingService {

    private final LockRequestRule lockRequestRule;

    public MortgagePricingService(LockRequestRule lockRequestRule) {
        this.lockRequestRule = lockRequestRule;
    }

    public String processLockRequest(LockRequest lockRequest) {
        // Check if lock request is valid based on the rule
        boolean isLockRequestValid = lockRequestRule.isLockRequestValid(lockRequest);
        if (isLockRequestValid) {
            return "PASS";
        } else {
            return "FAIL";
        }
    }
}

Step 5: Expose the Logic via REST API

You will need to expose this logic via a REST controller to allow users to submit lock requests and get the results.
MortgageController Class

This controller will expose an API endpoint to process lock requests.

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/mortgage")
public class MortgageController {

    private final MortgagePricingService mortgagePricingService;

    public MortgageController(MortgagePricingService mortgagePricingService) {
        this.mortgagePricingService = mortgagePricingService;
    }

    @PostMapping("/processLockRequest")
    public String processLockRequest(@RequestBody LockRequest lockRequest) {
        return mortgagePricingService.processLockRequest(lockRequest);
    }
}

Step 6: LockRequest DTO

You can use a Data Transfer Object (DTO) for receiving the request in the POST body, which will be used to validate the conditions.

public class LockRequest {
    private Product product;
    private SellerSettings sellerSettings;
    private GlobalSettings globalSettings;

    // Getters and Setters
}

Step 7: Example Data in the Controller

When you send a POST request, the LockRequest DTO should contain the necessary data for the lock request:

{
  "product": {
    "productId": "12345",
    "automatedLockApprovals": true
  },
  "sellerSettings": {
    "automatedLockApprovals": true
  },
  "globalSettings": {
    "automatedLockApprovals": true
  }
}

Step 8: Testing the Logic

You will need to write unit tests to ensure the logic works correctly. Use JUnit and Mockito to test the service and rule logic.
Example Unit Test:

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.Mock;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class MortgagePricingServiceTest {

    @Mock
    private LockRequestRule lockRequestRule;

    @Test
    public void testProcessLockRequest() {
        // Create mock data
        Product product = new Product();
        product.setAutomatedLockApprovals(true);

        SellerSettings sellerSettings = new SellerSettings();
        sellerSettings.setAutomatedLockApprovals(true);

        GlobalSettings globalSettings = new GlobalSettings();
        globalSettings.setAutomatedLockApprovals(true);

        LockRequest lockRequest = new LockRequest();
        lockRequest.setProduct(product);
        lockRequest.setSellerSettings(sellerSettings);
        lockRequest.setGlobalSettings(globalSettings);

        // Setup mock behavior
        when(lockRequestRule.isLockRequestValid(lockRequest)).thenReturn(true); // Simulating valid lock request

        // Create the service and call the method
        MortgagePricingService service = new MortgagePricingService(lockRequestRule);
        String result = service.processLockRequest(lockRequest);

        // Assert the result
        assertEquals("PASS", result);
    }
}

Step 9: Enhancing the Logic

As your mortgage pricing engine evolves, you may consider adding more complex conditions or rules. For example:

    Allow dynamic configurations of the lock approval conditions.

    Use a rule engine like Drools for more flexible rule management.

    Handle more sophisticated error cases or exceptions based on business needs.

Conclusion

The steps provided break down the requirement into manageable components and implement them in a Spring-based Java application. By structuring the code in service classes, domain models, and REST controllers, you create a maintainable and scalable solution for the mortgage pricing engine. The logic can easily be extended to handle more complex rules or further business requirements.
